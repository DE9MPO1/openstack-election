Hello Infra,

I am nominating myself for one more go at PTL. This will be my fifth
cycle as PTL if elected, and I think it is healthy for the project and
team to have a strong rotation of leadership. As a result I do not
plan to run for PTL in the 'V' cycle.

Considering this, I would like to put a focus on mentoring and growing
the team over the 'U' cycle. One of the goals we have with the OpenDev
project is to increase the user base of our hosting systems and as a
side effect of that to help grow the team too. During the 'U' cycle,
as PTL, I would like to personally focus on this portion of our OpenDev
plans.

It is worth acknowledging that I do not think I would be in a position
to do that if we haven't already had a successful Train cycle,
particularly in making OpenDev a reality. Thank you to everyone that
helped us make OpenDev a reality over the last six months. We will need
to keep pushing to make OpenDev the best software hosting toolchain
possible in order to continue to accomplish the other goals we have set.
I hope to continue to have your help and support.

The other major task we will need to keep pushing on is modernization
of our configuration management and deployments. We continue to make
consistent progress here, but we cannot let up if we want to have a
sustainable system for the future.

If these goals seems worthwhile I'd love to have your vote.

Thank you,
Clark
