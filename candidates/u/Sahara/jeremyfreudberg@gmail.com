Hello all!

This is an official announcement of my candidacy for PTL of Sahara for the "U"
development cycle, in continuation of my duties during Train.

I propose that focus areas for "U" be the same as for Train. Take a look at
my announcement from last election season for more information on those areas
and on my background.

Thanks for your consideration and here's to a great cycle.

Best,
Jeremy
