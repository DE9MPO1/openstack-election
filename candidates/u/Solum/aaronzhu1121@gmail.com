Hi,

I'd like to nominate myself to continue to serve as Solum PTL
through the Ussuri cycle.

My goals for the Ussuri cycle in the following areas:

 * Integration of Solum with Zun.
 * Make solum can be support oslo.privsep.
 * Acknowledgment of OpenStack-wide Goals.

I'm happy to welcome new contributors to the project.

Regards,

Rong Zhu
