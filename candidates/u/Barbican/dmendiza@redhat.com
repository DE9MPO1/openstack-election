I would like to announce my candidacy to continue to serve as Barbican PTL
for the U cycle.

My goals for this next cycle is to continue to improve the usability of the
client libraries, especially getting feature parity between python-barbicanclient
and openstacksdk.key_manager to support the Image Encryption cross-project
effort.

Thank you,
Douglas Mendiz√°bal
