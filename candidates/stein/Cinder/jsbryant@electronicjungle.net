All,

This letter is to indicate my interest in continuing to serve as
the Cinder PTL for the Stein release. This would be my third
release as PTL and am happy to continue leading this great project.

As I look back at the last two releases we have gotten some
good things done.  The implementation of multi-attach has
been a goal of Cinder for quite some time and I am glad to
have been able to help make this happen.  We have also seen
a change from trying to get new features implemented in Cinder
to fixing bugs and making Cinder more user friendly and stable.
During the Rocky release we have continued to improve our
documentation, have worked on improving HA support and removed
a lot of old code that did not need to remain in tree.
I think this is an important evolution in the Cinder project:
to focus on stability, usability and maintainability of our code.

With that said I think the Stein release is going to be a challenging
release for Cinder.  We have the following issues that are going
to need to be addressed:

* Migration to Storyboard
* Dwindling review support
* Making decisions around the Placement Service and Cinder
* Continuing discussion around Cinder as a Stand-alone service

I am hoping that I will be able to use my experience over
the last two releases to move the above issues forward.

Sincerely,
Jay Bryant (jungleboyj)
