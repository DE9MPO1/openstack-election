Hello Infrastructure Electorate,

I am going to put my name into the election hat for a third go at
Infrastructure PTL. For the Rocky cycle I had wanted to help get the
Zuul v3 release out the door, upgrade systems and services, welcome new
projects, and improve the onboarding process for the Infra team. Overall
I think we did a great job: Zuul release happened and is now an
independent project, we upgraded to Gerrit 2.13, and we have Zuul
running jobs against Kata and other new top level projects.

I cannot take individual credit for these things. We have managed
to work together to accomplish this and more. If you will have me, I
would like to help guide the Infrastructure team through the next six
months as we look ahead to even more exciting goals.

This is not a complete list, but the big items include:

  * Modernize our configuration management tooling.
  * Make a push to get off of aging Ubuntu Trusty servers.
  * Work through the Winterscale effort and get better at serving new
    and existing top level projects.
  * Continue to refine the onboarding process and take advantage of new
    users as a fresh set of potential Infra contributors.

These are big changes, and I doubt they will be easy to implement. They
are also exciting changes, and I am exciting to work through them with
you.

Thank you for your consideration,
Clark
