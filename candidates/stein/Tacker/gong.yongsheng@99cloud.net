This is my self-nomination to continue running as Tacker PTL for the
stein cycle.

We have more guys joining us, and new features are done here in Rocky cycle::

 - NS with vnffg feature, which completes the last part from ETSI concept.
 - Placement policy which makes more choices for us to place VNF's VDUs
 - Enable multiple node CI tests

In Rocky cycle, I plan to:

- Continue to stablize tacker and make it of production quality by breaking
  tacker server into more components.
- Make tacker more ESTI compatible
- Enhance container based VNF


Thanks for your consideration.
