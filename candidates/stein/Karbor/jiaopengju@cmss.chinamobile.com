Hi all,

I would like to nominate myself to be the Karbor PTL for the Stein cycle.

I began to contribute to Karbor project since 2016, as a core reviewer from
Queens cycle. It is my pleasure to work with the great team to make this
project much more better. I must say that, chenying is a very good person, he
did excellent job for recent cycles, and did a lot to make the Karbor community
going. Thanks for all his working for Karbor.

For me, I will still have enough energy and focus my time on Karbor community
in future cycles, to make Karbor more popular, more usable, and meet the end
users' needs in different scenarios.

In Rocky, we mainly focused on bug fixing and documentation. For the next
cycle, I think we will main focus on the following items:

- Optimization the implementation of multiple nodes of operation engine
- Make the implementation for cross-site backup and restore more stable and
  effective
- Add more protection plugins
- Help drive further collaboration with other OpenStack projects
- Update the documentations, ensure it is consistent with the latest release
- Get Karbor community going and grow the team of contributors

I provided many reviews and commits in past two cycles, and I think I have a
deep understanding of codebase and inner working of Karbor, so I am coming to
nominate myself to be the Karbor PTL for next cycle.

I would be honored to have your vote.

Thanks,
Jiao Pengju (jiaopengju)
