I would like to announce my candidacy for PTL of the Requirements project for
the Stein cycle.

The following will be my goals for the cycle, in order of importance:

1. The primary goal is to keep a tight rein on global-requirements and
upper-constraints updates.  (Keep things working well)

2. Un-cap requirements where possible (stuff like eventlet).

3. Publish constraints and requirements to streamline the freeze process.

https://bugs.launchpad.net/openstack-requirements/+bug/1719006 is the bug
tracking the publish job.

4. Audit global-requirements and upper-constraints for redundancies.  One of
the rules we have for new entrants to global-requirements and/or
upper-constraints is that they be non-redundant.  Keeping that rule in mind,
audit the list of requirements for possible redundancies and if possible,
reduce the number of requirements we manage.

I look forward to continue working with you in this cycle, as your PTL or not.

Thanks for your time,
Matthew Thode
