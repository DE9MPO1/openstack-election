Hello folks!

I'd like to nominate myself for the TripleO PTL role for the Stein cycle.

Alex has done a great job as a PTL: The project is progressing nicely with many
new, exciting features and uses for TripleO coming to fruition recently. It's a
great time for the project. But, there's more work to be done.

I have served the TripleO community as a core-reviewer for some years now and,
more recently, by driving the Security Squad. This project has been a
great learning experience for me, both technically (I got to learn even more of
OpenStack) and community-wise. Now I wish to better serve the community further
by bringing my experiences into PTL role. While I have not yet served as PTL
for a project before,I'm eager to learn the ropes and help improve the
community that has been so influential on me.

For Stein, I would like to focus on:

* Increasing TripleO's usage in the testing of other projects
  Now that TripleO can deploy a standalone OpenStack installation, I hope it
  can be leveraged to add value to other projects' testing efforts. I hope this
  would subsequentially help increase TripleO's testing coverage, and reduce
  the footprint required for full-deployment testing.

* Technical Debt & simplification
  We've been working on simplifying the deployment story and battle technical
  depth -- letâ€™s keep  this momentum going.  We've been running (mostly) fully
  containerized environments for a couple of releases now; I hope we can reduce
  the number of stacks we create, which would in turn simplify the project
  structure (at least on the t-h-t side). We should also aim for the most
  convergence we can achieve (e.g. CLI and UI workflows).

* CI and testing
  The project has made great progress regarding CI and testing; lets keep this
  moving forward and get developers easier ways to bring up testing
  environments for them to work on and to be able to reproduce CI jobs.

Thanks!
