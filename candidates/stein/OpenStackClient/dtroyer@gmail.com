I am running for re-election as the OpenStackClient PTL.

OpenStackClient development is expected to pick up again soon as the
release of OpenStack SDK 1.0 will open the gates to consuming that
implementation and correctly adding microversion support for the
project APIs that support it.

I thank you and am honored by your continued support.
