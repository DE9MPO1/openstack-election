Hi,

I would like to submit my candidacy to continue as PTL of Solum for
the Pike cycle.

Looking back on the Ocata cycle, some of the highlights for us are:
- Adding kolla-ansible role [1] and kolla container [2] for Solum
  (Many thanks to Wei Cao for spearheading this effort)
- Completing the Ocata goal of removing incubated Oslo libraries
- Adding Zhu Rong to our core team [3].

The key focus areas for the Pike cycle, which we can pursue together, include:
- finding an alternative for nova-docker in our devstack setup
- completing the work that we started on adding support for building applications into VM images
- making it easy for operators to configure and use different build and deployment options

You might remember, we have been using nova-docker as the virt driver
in our devstack setup. However nova-docker is being retired [4].
So it is important that we find a replacement that can work in our devstack setup.
We have been looking at Zun in this regard [5]. In this cycle I hope
we can finish this work, thus removing our dependence on nova-docker.

One of our contributors has been working on adding support
to build applications into VM images using Packer [6].
You can find the details about this use-case and approach
in his thesis [7]. I hope that we are able to complete this work in this cycle.

Lastly, we should continue working on the Python 3.5 support [8],
which has been approved as the community-wide goal for this cycle.

Regards,
Devdatta Kulkarni
