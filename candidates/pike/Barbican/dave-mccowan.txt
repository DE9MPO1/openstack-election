Fellow Barbicaneers,

I'd like to nominate myself to continue to serve as Barbican PTL
through the Pike cycle.

First and foremost, I want to maintain our team's culture.

My goals for the Pike cycle are to continue the progress made during
the Ocata cycle in the following areas:

1) Grow the Barbican team of contributors and core reviewers.
2) Collaborate with other OpenStack projects with joint blueprints.
3) Improve our project maturity index by addressing documentation and process
   items.
4) Maintain our high standards for code reviews and unit and functional tests.
5) Be diligent with backporting bug fixes to stable releases.

In addition, I'd like to focus on three additional areas:

1) Continue the work started with Tempest driven cross-project test cases.
2) Work toward delivering a deployment model that is secure enough
for many production environments, while also being easy to deploy and
operate.
3) Shrink our backlog of open bugs.

Thank you in advance for this opportunity to serve.
