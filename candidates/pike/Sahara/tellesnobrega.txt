Hello everyone!

I'd like to announce my candidacy for PTL of the Data
Processing project (Sahara), and to describe what I hope to do to help Sahara
move forward.

First of all I would like to introduce myself. I've been working on the Sahara
project since the Icehouse release, and since the Newton release I have been a
member of the Sahara core reviewer team.
I was responsible for introducing the Storm plugin to Sahara and have
maintained it since its creation. Other than that, I've been working on many
different features and small fixes to Sahara.

Here are a summary of my contributions to Sahara:
Reviews:
* All-time: http://stackalytics.com/?module=sahara-group&user_id=tellesmvn&release=all
* Ocata: http://stackalytics.com/?module=sahara-group&user_id=tellesmvn&release=ocata
Commits:
* All-time: http://stackalytics.com/?module=sahara-group&user_id=tellesmvn&release=all&metric=commits
* Ocata: http://stackalytics.com/?module=sahara-group&user_id=tellesmvn&release=ocata&metric=commits

As PTL I will coordinate the team to reach community goals, manage
Sahara releases, and track all activities related to new features
in Sahara. Also I plan to minimize the open bug list by organizing some bug
triage days and bug fix weeks. Improving documentation is also a priority to
allow Sahara to grow.

My main focus for this coming release is finding ways to grow the Sahara team.
Currently we have mentees and I would like to improve that kind of integration
to bring new people to the team.

As for Sahara features, I plan to establish a team and set deadlines to deliver
API v2. I will also focus on preparing Sahara for Python 3.5

I hope that Sahara will continue to grow in the Pike release.
