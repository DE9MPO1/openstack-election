Hi everyone!

I'd like to announce my candidacy for PTL of the Stable Branch Maintenance
Team.

For those who don't know me, I am a Glance Core Reviewer, Stable Core
Reviewer, Security Core Reviewer, and Release CPL.  I've been an active
contributor to Stable Team meetings and mailing discussions.

I'd like to continue the work that Tony has started these last two cycles.
Namely, I'd like to:

1. Work with project teams to foster better relationships and to understand
   how decisions they make for master affect their stable branches.

   Further, continuing Tony's work, I'd like to focus on how the changes being
   made to how drivers are managed and maintained will effect stable branches.

2. Work with cross-project liaisons to help project teams grow their stable
   branch teams as necessary.  Specifically, there is a large difference in
   how teams decide to backport changes.  Standardizing the decision process
   would be beneficial to every project's user base.

3. Holding regular team meetings. We presently rarely have meetings due to the
   chosen times being inconvenient for different members.

4. Working with the release team to improve the self-service tooling that they
   have created.  Specifically, I would work with both our excellent
   Infrastructure team and Release team to automate the retirement of stable
   branches.

If you have questions about these items or about me, please do ask. I will
reply as promptly as possible.

Cheers,
Ian Cordasco
