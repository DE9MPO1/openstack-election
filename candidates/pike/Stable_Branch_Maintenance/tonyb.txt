Hi everybody!

I'd like to continue to serve as the Stable branch maintenance PTL.

As I stated in my Ocata election platform [1] I have a few things on my TODO
list:

 1. Work with project teams to understand how decisions taken on master will
    impact their stable branches.  Specifically projects with a driver model.
 2. Work with project teams to implement constraints support
 3. Growing the project specific, and stable-maint teams
 4. Re-establishing regular team meetings and presence in #openstack-stable
 5. Producing tooling to aid projects teams, release managers and the stable
    team to keep stable branches current and released with a regular cadence
 6. Producing tooling and procedures to help retire projects as required

It's bitter sweet to admit that many of these items are *still* on my list for
Pike.

 1. This is an ongoing effort where the effort today pays off in 6 months :/
 2. Has been handed off to the Requirements team[2] and has seen good progress
    on master [3] which need to to translate onto stable branches.
 3. This is a long term effort but I feel like we've had some success here,
    especially in light of challenges facing *all* core teams.
 4. We've had mixed success here.  I'm not convinced this is working.  It's
    starting to feel to me like perhaps the stable team isn't big enough to
    really need meetings.  Using #openstack-stable and an office channel seems
    to be be working but again would work better with a larger team.
 5. The Realease team has made awesome progress on the automation side of
    things and we're working on increasing review bandwidth but the tools to
    help PTLs and CPLs decide *when* a release is needed is still immature.
 6. This is getting better but for this to be fully realised requires an
    upgrade in gerrit.  This upgrade should provide the fine grained ACLs
    needed to make this self and close to self service.

I'd appreciate another cycle to progress these items, if y'all will have me.


Yours Tony.
