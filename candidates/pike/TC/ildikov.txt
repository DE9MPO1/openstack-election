Hi All,

I would like to throw my hat in the ring to be part of the OpenStack Technical
Committee.

I'm working for the OpenStack Foundation as Ecosystem Technical Lead where
my responsibility is to help our members to succeed with OpenStack both as
software and community. My main focus areas are Telecom/NFV and on boarding
new contributors.

My OpenStack journey started more than three years ago by adding rich query
functionality to Ceilometer where I’m currently a core reviewer. By my contributions
I’m the constant voice of usability and maintainability aspects while encouraging
collaboration within and between project teams. Among other projects I’ve been
contributing to Cinder, Nova and OpenStack Manuals[1] as well.

I would like to increase diversity in the TC group, but more importantly my
goal is to add fresh blood to the group driving this community. In my
opinion it is crucial to constantly revisit items from a different perspective and
let new voices articulate their views and ideas in order to see the big picture. Long
term this can ensure that OpenStack keeps its adaptability to continue to be a
smoothly functioning ecosystem providing a stable and successful software package.

In the course of my current role within the Foundation I continuously learn
about the goals and challenges of our ecosystem companies who are productifying,
distributing and operating OpenStack. As my current focus turns more towards Telecom
vendors and operators, and NFV and SDN related use cases I see this as an area,
where notwithstanding the already ongoing great work there is still room for further
improvements. As a former employee of a Telecom vendor during the past few years I
saw and experienced the difficulties and even pain of trying to find the common
language between the two groups and making the contributions happen. While the
situation is improving, I think it is very important to continue to help the Telecom
industry in the transformation to fit into the cloud terminology and the open source
era. By this process OpenStack can leverage the advantages that this completely
different set of priorities and requirements could offer, such as increased stability
and advanced networking functionality, like how it was demonstrated in Barcelona
during the keynotes [2].

I’ve been involved in OPNFV [3] for about two years now and I’m also one of the
ambassadors [4]. I’m continuously working on to find the connection points between
the two communities [7] to build a large ecosystem which fits OpenStack's current
priorities in the sense of actively supporting and being the foundation for NFV. As
part of the TC I would like to continue to help the ongoing joint activities to create
an interoperability test suite for the NFV area and have OPNFV’s CI system integrated
with OpenStack to get close to immediate feedback while developing new Telecom
and NFV related features. As the adoption of OpenStack in the Telecom area is
continuously growing and operators are looking at OpenStack as a main building
block for their systems, I would like to serve as a representative in the technical
driving force of OpenStack, who can operate as a translator to build a common
roadmap.

During the past few years I’ve been driving the activities to add the volume
multi-attach functionality to Nova, which turned into a collaborative activity between
the two teams to simplify the interaction between the two services. By this work
we are increasing maintainability of the code bases and stability of the services.
Driven by the experiences of this work I see cross-project collaboration as an area,
to further improve. As part of the TC I would like to continue driving cross-project
activities, where I would like to help with making the interactions between the teams
more efficient to ensure end-to-end feature implementation and continuous code
maintenance and improvement.

I’m also involved in the Upstream Institute activities to provide guidance to
newcomers to the community. As our community is a continuously changing
environment it is crucial to be welcoming and ensure we distribute the knowledge
about our services and code base while remaining open to transfer responsibilities
to newer community members. To help build and maintain this mindset, we are
building a liaison team to participate in the training activities while also have the
constant awareness of on-boarding new members to the teams. As a TC member I
would like to help the project teams to share and maintain this mindset to help the
contributor ecosystem to remain healthy and balanced and our teams to become
more efficient. As part of this mission I would continue to invest energy in bringing
sessions on stage at the OpenStack Summits[5][6] to share the lessons I learnt
during the past three and a half years.

Thank you for reading through my thoughts. It is an honor to be part of OpenStack,
which is why I would like to take part in helping to further the efforts of providing a
package that can serve the whole industry and which is backed up by a growing
and smoothly functioning ecosystem.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best Regards,
Ildikó (ildikov)
