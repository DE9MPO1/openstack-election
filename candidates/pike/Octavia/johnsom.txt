Hello OpenStack community!

I would like to nominate myself for the Octavia PTL position during the Pike
series.  I am currently the Octavia PTL for the Ocata release and would like to
continue to help this incredible team to enhance and evolve network load
balancing in OpenStack.

For those of you that do not know me, I work for Rackspace and I am a technical
lead for Octavia in the OpenStack Innovation Center (OSIC).  Prior to joining
Rackspace I worked for Hewlett-Packard for fifteen years on data center
automation, distributed network systems, embedded system design, and big data.

During the Ocata series we spun Octavia out of the neutron stadium and became
a new top level OpenStack project.  We have also made good progress towards
merging neutron-lbaas into the Octavia project.

Looking forward to Pike my goals would be to finish the neutron-lbaas/Octavia
merge, enable the active/active topology, and continue our work to
enhance the testing and documentation for Octavia.

Thank you for your support during Ocata and your consideration for Pike,

Michael Johnson (johnsom)
