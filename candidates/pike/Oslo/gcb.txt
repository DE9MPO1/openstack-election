Hi All,

I would like to announce my candidacy for the Oslo PTL election.

I have been involved with Oslo since the last few years, first as a contributor
and then a core reviewer and have had the opportunity to work with a great team
and community. For more information about me, please refer to:
https://www.openstack.org/community/members/profile/14945

We achieved some significant milestones in the Ocata cycle and we have the
fortune of having a number of experienced and previous PTLs in the team that
makes the job of a new PTL easier. In the Pike cycle, we still focus on our
project mission: "aims to produce a set of Python libraries containing
code shared by OpenStack projects. The APIs provided by these libraries should
be high quality, stable, consistent, documented and generally applicable".

I believe our focus in the Pike cycle would include:

- Attract more developers to contribute for Oslo
- Spread more Oslo stuff to consuming projects.
- Improve documentations to help developers use Oslo libraries smoothly.
- Collect new ideas and generate new libraries.

Thank you for your consideration
