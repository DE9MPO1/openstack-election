Hello everyone,

I would like to announce my candidancy for PTL of Karbor for the Pike release
cycle.

My goals for the Pike cycle:
 - Adopt cycle-with-intermediary release model
 - Stable reference implementation for the protectables and protection
   plugins
 - Cooperate with Cinder for the work on Tiramisu and replication
 - Integration with Freezer
 - Document all pluggable interfaces (bank, protectable, protection)
 - Cross-site protect and restore
 - Advanced protection policy (retention)

Thanks,
Yuval
