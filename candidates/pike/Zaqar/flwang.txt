Hi all,

I've had the pleasure of serving the Zaqar community as PTL for the past three
cycles, and I'd like to continue for Pike cycle, if you'll have me.

For Pike release, things I'd like to do:

1. Scalability
   A scalable service should be able to process increases in load without
obvious degradation of latency or availability. For Zaqar, "load" can refer to
various dimensions of usage:
   1) number of queues
   2) number of publishers
   3) number of subscribers
   4) number of messages
   5) size of messages
   6) rate of messages published or consumed
We have merged the OSProfiler patch in Ocata, so it would be nice to leverage
it to do more benchmarks to improve above metrics.

2. Availability
   Fortunately, Zaqar has a simple architecture which makes keeping its
availability relatively easy. That said, we need to improve the behaviours of
Zaqar so that it can gracefully failing over in a way that is unnoticeable to
end users.

3. Latency
   Latency is a typical time-based measure for the performance of a system.
Obvious, Zaqar would like to minimize latency wherever possible. There are two
most important latency metrics I would like to improve in Pike are:
   1) The amount of time to claim a message
   2) The amount of time to deliver a message from publisher zaqar server
   3) The amount of time to deliver a message from zaqar to subscriber

4. Encourage diversity in our Community
   We are still a small team needs to grow. I would like to encourage more
people, organizations to join Zaqar community to make sure we have a good
coverage.

It's a fantastic experience working with this amazing team and I know without
the dedication and hard work of everyone who has contributed to Zaqar we can't
make those success stories of Ocata happen. I would be pleased to serve
as PTL for another cycle and I'd appreciate your vote.

Thanks for your consideration!
