I would like to propose my candidacy for Dragonflow PTL position.

I have been working on Dragonflow for over a year, including related
projects such as Neutron and Openstack-Ansible.

The previous cycle was short, but we have made a lot of progress. I would
like to leverage that momentum and continue what we have done so far.

My goal for Dragonflow is to make it a reference architecture to implement
networking and distributed networking services in an easy and simple
manner while supporting production grade and large scale requirements.

I think that Dragonflow plug-able architecture is proving to be a strong
choice we made and is even being considered at other OpenStack networking
projects. This architecture can be extended further, to become more plug-able,
and allow external vendors to write their own drivers and applications.

I also believe that our simplicity can be very appealing to users that
want a simple network virtualisation solution part of OpenStack.

For the next cycle, I would like to see Dragonflow become a viable
choice for cloud deployments. This means a heavy stress on stabilisation,
deployment, and performance.

I would also like to see new features make it into the release, such as
FWaaS, and LBaaS.

I think Dragonflow also has a lot to offer outside of Openstack. With
some necessary additions such as API and AAA, Dragonflow can be a
virtual network implementation regardless of the ecosystem in which it
is used. Therefore, it could improve upon any cloud-networking system.

Thank you,
Omer Anson (oanson).
