Hello everyone,

I have been the Cinder PTL since the Mitaka release and I would love the
opportunity to be the PTL one more time.

I work for Dell EMC, working with storage for the last 14+ years. I am
lucky enough that I have the support to focus on OpenStack for my job.

I also have the support I've needed to both get out and get in front of
developers and users to support learning and using OpenStack. Over the
last year I have been able to attend a few OpenStack Days events and
attend the last Operators Midcycle. As PTL I can continue to spend the
time educating and evangelizing OpenStack.

More importantly, as PTL I can do whatever I can to eliminate
distractions and ease the way for the incredible work that members of
the community are doing. Through code reviews and helping coordinate
support within the group and across projects, I hope I can help
everyone get things accomplished.

Now that we are past the shorter Ocata cycle, I think we can start
focusing again on the larger efforts that we've had outstanding for a
few releases now and getting some of the important specs implemented.
I hope to help get capabilities like multiattach working across Cinder
and Nova. I also hope to work with the vendors that are such a large
part of the usefulness of Cinder to both make sure that they are
properly engaging with the OpenStack community, and that the community
is also aware of and able to work with the vendors to help them be
involved.

I hope you will consider me for the Pike PTL.

Thanks!
Sean
