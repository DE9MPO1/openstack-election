This is my candidacy for PTL role in the Packaging-Rpm OpenStack team
for the Pike release cycle.

Iâ€™m working on creating, building, polishing and maintaining Linux packages for
OpenStack projects with  various dependencies for few years since IceHouse
launch. It allowed me to accumulate deep knowledge base about core OpenStack
functionality.
The main goal for the Packaging-Rpm project, as I see it, is to create community
OpenStack packages for dev-core and the rest of projects if possible or
necessary. These packages already developed and used by MOS, SUSE & RDO.
I wish my experience as package maintainer could help developers all over the
world to make their work easier and more transparent with efficiency pushed to
higher level.


There are a few topics to concentrate on during Pike cycle:

Finish with dev-core project packages, maintain them and back-port in case of
necessity to previous releases.
Keep maintenance of already built packages.
Elaborate functional tests for packages which could be used within CI.
