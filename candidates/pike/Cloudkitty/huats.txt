Hello everyone,

I would like to announce my candidacy for PTL of Cloudkitty.

During the Ocata cycle we have been able open up our community with the
integration of some new contributors and new cores from different companies
(which was a key from my point of view).
We also have been to add many improvment mainly to ease the usage and
configuration of cloudkitty.

During the Pike cycle the focus I am looking for is to extend to spectrum
of cloukitty integration (being able to fetch more metrics for more
services), also to continue to help developers when they want to
participate in cloudkitty (which is already an ongoing work) and to
continue to extend the collaboration with other OpenStack projects.
Finally I am decided also to continue to work to support the wider
ecosystem adoption of Cloudkitty as the best solution for chargeback and
rating.

I would also like to take this opportunity to thank all members of the
OpenStack community who helped our team during the lasts cycles.

Thank you,
     Christophe
