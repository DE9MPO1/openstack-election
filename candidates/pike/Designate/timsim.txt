Hi everyone,

I would like to nominate myself as a candidate for Designate PTL for the Pike
cycle. For anyone that doesn't know me, I'm Tim Simmons (timsim). I've been
working on Designate since mid-2013, and been part of Designate Core since
2015.

Over that time I've done lots of things for Designate, big and small. Some of
the bigger bits include the recent rearchitecture called "the Worker Model",
the second coming of the "Designate agent", and asynchronous zone imports and
exports. I was also one of the champions behind the ultimately disastrous
Golang discussion, whoops.

The Designate community has always been small, more so than ever now. But I'm
willing to step up and take responsibility for the project in the vacuum that's
been created by factors out of our control.

The things I'd like to focus on in Pike are stability, bugs, and documentation.

We've had some recent changes that, while they look good and are a solid base
for the future of the project, are definitely hiding some bugs and operational
hiccups. I'd like to make sure that the project is solid for years to come, and
that it's easy for new users and contributors to use. We've got a nice little
backlog of bugs that I'd like to get fixed, because, well bugs are bad! I also
want to ensure that new users and contributors have everything they need to
get going with Designate, and our docs are in need of some love to make that
happen.

Thanks for your consideration, and I look forward to continuing work on
Designate,

Tim Simmons (timsim)
