I'd be honored to continue to serve as PTL for Swift.

During the Pike cycle, these are the things I will focus on:

* Working through the new languages process that the TC has approved,
  as it relates to the golang work in Swift
* Continued progress on major ongoing efforts like global cluster
  improvements, operational improvements, and performance improvements
* Improving the health of the community, specifically by seeing how the
  PTG/forum split and lack of a midcycle affects things

As the Swift PTL, I feel it's my duty to enable the community to solve
these problems by making every community member more productive. This
is my focus.
