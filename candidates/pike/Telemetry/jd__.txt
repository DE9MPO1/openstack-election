Hi!

As I can observe every end of cycle, the Telemetry team has been doing an
amazing job making progress on the projects we manage this cycle. Gnocchi
gained features and traction, Aodh got new contributors, Panko started his own
destiny and Ceilometer is reducing and improving its footprint.

If you look at the release goals that have been decided or are being discussed
(Python 3.5, mod_wsgi deployment, oslo usageâ€¦), you will notice our projects
are way ahead and I think it's tremendous. And our team is continuously
improving the rest of OpenStack by contributing to Oslo too. I reiterate what I
said last cycle: think it's a great achievement for a small team like us.

So, yes, I envision us continuing on this trajectory, setting the bar higher
for everyone. That's why I'm running again this time to serve the team,
managing the project in a transparent way and do everything I can to grow our
community and make people feel welcome.

We all know how barely useful we made the PTL be, and I count on keeping it
that way. :-)

Happy hacking,

jd
