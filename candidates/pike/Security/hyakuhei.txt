Well it's that time again, I'd like to throw my hat in the ring once
again and nominate myself for the role of Security PTL.

During this shortened cycle we've continued to drive various projects:

* Issue OpenStack Security Notes and provide some degree
* Support for teams who are not yet Vulnerability Managed
* Bandit to provide Python Static Analysis
* Syntribos for OpenStack project fuzzing
* Maintaining and updating the security guide
* Receiving the CII best practice award

For my part, this year has been more about managing the project,
maintaining our momentum and working with the team to behave more like
a typical OpenStack project, a goal I set out on the security blog[1]
and something I think we are well on the way to achieving.

My intention for the next release is to complete the scorecard outlined
in the security blog[1] and to bring in more OSSN authors. Security
notes are becoming increasingly important as vulnerabilities are found
in projects that are not supported by the VMT. During this cycle we have
seen a steep rise in embargoed notes, the work for which is not
reflected in our public gerrit but is extremely important.

I'd like to extend my thanks to all those in the security project who
dedicated time and effort to our many activities. We are not a big
OpenStack project and most of our members are donating their time,
outside of their employment, so thank you all for your contributions.

Cheers
-Rob
