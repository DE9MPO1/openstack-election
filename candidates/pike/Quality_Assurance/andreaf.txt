Dear all,

I’d like to announce my candidacy for PTL of the QA Program for the Pike cycle.

I started working with OpenStack towards the end of 2011. Since 2014 I’ve been
a core developer for Tempest.
I’ve always aimed for Tempest to be able to run against any OpenStack cloud;
a lot of my contributions to Tempest have been driven by that.
I’ve worked on QA for the OpenStack community, for an OpenStack based public
cloud as well as for an OpenStack distribution.

I believe that quality engineers should develop innovative, high quality
open-source tools and tests.

The OpenStack community has built an amazing set of tools and services to
handle quality engineering at such a large scale.
The number of tests executed, the test infrastructure and amount of test data
produced can still be difficult to handle.
Complexity can inhibit new contributors as well as existing ones, not only for
the QA program but for OpenStack in general as well.

If elected, in the Pike cycle I would like to focus on two areas.

- QA team support to the broader OpenStack community
    - Finish the work on Tempest stable interfaces for plugins and support
      existing plugins in the transition
    - Keep an open channel with the broader community when setting priorities

- Promote contribution to the QA program, by:
    - removing cruft from Tempest code
    - making it easier to know “what’s going on” when a test job fails
        - focus on tools that help triage and debug gate failures (OpenStack
          Health, Stackviz)
        - leverage the huge amount of test data we produce every day to
          automate as much as possible the failure triage and issue discovery
          processes

I hold the QA crew in great esteem, and I would be honoured to serve as the
next PTL.

Thank you
