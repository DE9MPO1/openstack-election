Hi All,

First and foremost would like to wish you all a successful 2017 ahead and
with this I'm announcing my PTL candidacy of the Quality Assurance team
for the Pike release cycle.

I am glad to work in OpenStack community and would like to thank all the
contributors who supported me to explore new things which brings out my
best for the community.

Let me introduce myself, briefly. I have joined the OpenStack community
development in 2014 during mid of Ice-House release. Currently, I'm contributing
in QA projects and Nova as well as a core member in Tempest.
Since Barcelona Summit, I volunteered  as mentor in the upstream training.
It‘s always a great experience to introduce OpenStack upstream workflow
to new contributors and encourage them.

Following are my contribution activities:
 * Review:  http://stackalytics.com/?release=all&metric=marks&user_id=ghanshyammann
 * Commit:  http://stackalytics.com/?release=all&metric=commits&user_id=ghanshyammann

I have worked on some key areas on QA like Interfaces migration to lib, JSON
schema response validation(for compute), API Microversion testing framework in
Tempest, Improve test coverage and Bug Triage etc.

QA program has been immensely improved since it was introduced which increased
upstream development quality as well as helping production Cloud for their
testing and stability. We have a lot of ideas from many different contributors
to keep improving the QA which is phenomenal and I truly appreciate.

Moving forwards, following are my focus areas for Pike Cycle:

* Help the other Projects' developments and Plugin Improvement:
    OpenStack projects consider the quality is important and QA team needs to
    provide useful testing framework for them. Projects who all needs to implement
    their tempest tests in plugin, focus will be to help plugin tests improvement and
    so projects quality. Lot of Tempest interfaces are moving towards stable
    interfaces, existing plugin tests needs to be fixed multiple times. We are
    taking care of those and helping them to migrate smoothly. But there are
    still many  interfaces going to migrate to lib and further to be adopted on
    plugin side. I’d like to have some mechanism/automation to trigger plugins
    to know about change interfaces before it breaks them. Also help them to use
    the framework correctly. This helps the other non-core projects’ tests.

* Improve QA projects for Production Cloud:
    This will be the main focus area. Having QA projects more useful for
    Production Cloud testing is/will be great achievement for QA team. This
    area has been improved a lot since last couple of cycles and still a lot
    to do. We have to improve Production scenario testing coverage and make all
    QA projects easy to configure and use. During Barcelona summit, 2 new
    projects are initiated which will definitely help to achieve this goal.
      *        RBAC Policy -  https://github.com/openstack/patrole
      *        HA testing  -  https://review.openstack.org/#/c/374667/
                              https://review.openstack.org/#/c/399618/
      *        Hoping for more in future
    There will be more focus on those projects and new ideas which will help
    production Cloud testing in more powerful way.

* JSON Schema *response* validation for projects:
    JSON schema response validation for compute APIs has been very helpful to
    keep the APIs quality and compatibility. Currently many projects support
    microversion which provides a way to introduce the APIs changes in Backward
    compatible way. I'd like to concentrate on response schema validation for
    those projects also. This helps the OpenStack interoperability and the APIs
    compatibility.

* Improve Documentation and UX:
    Documentation and UX are the key part for any software. There have been
    huge improvement in UX , documentation side and new Tempest workflow is
    available.  Still configuration and usage is the pain point for Users.
    During summit/ptg or other platforms I’d like us to have more feedbacks
    from users and improve accordingly. Making configuration easy for people
    is one of the area we will be focusing on.

* Bring on more contributor and core reviewers:
    QA projects have been one of the active projects during last couple of
    years and I'd like the team to mentor new contributors to help QA projects
    in planned goal and get them to a place where they will be ready for
    core reviewers.

* Migrate required Tempest Interfaces as stable to lib:
    We together have done great job in this area which helped plugin tests.
    In Service clients migration, Object Storage service client are left and
    all others have been moved as stable interfaces. Lot of others
    framework/interface also available in lib. But still lot of unstable
    interfaces are being used in Plugins which should be migrated to lib soon.
    In Pike cycle, we will wind up all remaining service client migration and
    other required interfaces.

* Last but not the least, Openness is great power of Open Source and so does
  OpenStack. All new ideas from anyone will be most welcome.

Thanks to previous QA PTL, Sean, Matthew, Kenichi who have shown great
leadership quality and taken QA projects to a new height. I have learnt
a lot from them which motivates me.

I look forward to contributing to all of these areas and more during the Pike
cycle.
