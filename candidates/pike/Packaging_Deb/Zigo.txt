Hi,

During the Newton cycle, we've been able to move all of our builds from
a vendor-based server to upstream infra. I served as PTL for the Ocata
cycle, even though nothing has been done for Ocata yet. Hopefully, we
will be able to do it before the final release, still. It is my hope
that we can continue the Packaging-Deb project as it has been a very
successful project for Newton.

Cheers,

Thomas Goirand (zigo)
