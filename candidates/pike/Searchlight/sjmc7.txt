I am announcing my candidacy for election as the PTL for Searchlight.
I have been a leading contributor since the beginning of Searchlight
and was the PTL for the Ocata cycle.

Ocata was a short cycle and we concentrated on a few achievable goals.
Of the big ticket features we set out to add, we got to all of them.

My goals for Pike if elected are also relatively modest and aimed at
increasing stability and awareness:

- Continuing to improve service coverage
- Improving support for versioned notifications as more projects
  transition to using them
- Continuing to support Elasticsearch 5 features while maintaining
  compatibility with 2.x, including testing both versions in CI
- Increasing participation from other projects (we've had good progress
  on this front with Nova and Glance)
- Working on integration with Horizon and Zaqar

It's been an honor serving as PTL for Ocata; I hope to continue for Pike.
