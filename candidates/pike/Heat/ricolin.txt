Hi All,

I would like to nominate myself to take the role of Heat PTL for Pike release.

I'd been involved with the project around two years. And it's my privilege to
work and learn within this great team. Heat become a width used project
across other projects with the ability to orchestrate large numbers of
resources in an OpenStack cluster. No doubt, heat will keep evolving.

Heat achieved some significant milestones in the ocata cycle. The memory
consuming has a huge drop down, convergence engine toward a more stable state,
and other great improvements and fixes. Still, we have more roads to roll in
Pike cycle:

- Cross projects integration and improvement
- Convergence Phase two
- Stability and performance
- Validation improvement
- Task scheduler improvement

Of cause our `run-of-the-mill` as usual:
- Ensuring that CI jobs are healthy (and we don't break other projects)
- On time releases with efficient coordination and collaboration
- Encourage more participants, to demo and convert more members to join us
- Cross project collaborations

As for my view of PTL's job, I think is to help on coordinate project
development tasks. And make sure whatever we're working, our developers,
operators, and users aware of it, and get the chances to feedback on it.
A communication bridge and a watchdog. I'm not the best or most experienced
technologists in the team, but luckily, we have a group of previous PTLs,
experienced, talented and ready to give hints or -2 to the new PTL. I'm sure
we would be able to make the goals as a team, target them as a team, and
resolved it as a team.

Hope you will consider me for Pike PTL.

Thank you!
Rico
