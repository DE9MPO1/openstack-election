Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more... I'm running
for reelection to a fourth term as Infrastructure PTL. In my many
years as a core reviewer and root sysadmin for OpenStack's community
infrastructure, I've striven to uphold the principles of open
collaboration and welcoming participation which define our team.

During this current (albeit abbreviated) cycle, I've tackled the
boring administrivia while the rest of you did exciting things like:

 * Kept our systems running and developers developing
 * Made great strides toward Zuul v3/Nodepool 1.0
 * Moved docs/developer.o.o from CloudSites to AFS
 * Added many new features and fixes in StoryBoard
 * Got all remaining projects testing on Ubuntu Xenial
 * Finished splitting out Puppet modules for CI management
 * Wrestled our wiki spam problem into a manageable state
 * Set up a Pholio service for UI/UX prototyping
 * Worked on the impending Gerrit and Zanata upgrades
 * Completed our artifact signing implementation
 * Opened up the governance site to additional committees
 * Automated branch creation as a part of release tooling
 * More stuff I've already forgotten (sorry if I left anyone out)

Consider this a huge thank-you to everyone who works on our
community infrastructure! I'm honored to have been allowed the
opportunity to enable so many great accomplishments, and am willing
to try and do it again for at least one more cycle if elected.
