I’m writing to announce my candidacy for Congress PTL (Pike).

First, I’d like to thank everyone for being a tremendous support
and a pleasure to work with in the Ocata cycle.

In the Ocata cycle, we made great progress in the robustness of
the distributed architecture, the rigor of the QA process, and
the mechanism for pre-packaged policies out-of-the-box.

For the Pike cycle, I hope to continue making great strides in
code robustness, usability, and ease-of-adoption, as well as high
value features identified through community engagement.

Thank you all once again!
