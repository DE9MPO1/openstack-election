Hi everyone!

I have been involved in OpenStack for about 3 years and big part of that period
it was Rally project.

Ocata cycle was short, so not all of items from my previous TODO list were
finished. There are a lot of short-term and long term tasks and I want to be
involved as much as possible. That is why I'm announcing my candidacy for
Rally PTL for the Pike release cycle.

* My goals for the Pike cycle

Release process:
 - do regular 3 weeks releases. Unfortunately, we started a big redesign of
   one of our components and it took too much time, so instead of 3 weeks for
   release, Rally 0.8.0 was released after 3 months. I'll do my best to achieve
   shorter releasing cycles.

Tasks:
 - Increase plugins-core team
 - Improve reporting system and provide more result types (subunit, junit,
   testrail and etc)
 - Continue work on Rally as a Service
 - Make rally certification even more user-friendly and cover more use-cases
 - Continue working on improving documentary
 - Provide a way to deliver rally plugins as python packages
 - Split Rally Core and OpenStack related plugins into 2 repos
 - Nested atomics
 - Finish task v2 format
 - Improve cleanup mechanism (including disaster cleanup)
