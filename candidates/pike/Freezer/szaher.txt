Hello everyone,

I'm happy to announce my candidacy to be the Freezer PTL for the Pike release
cycle.

The Freezer developers did a very good job over the past releases and I am sure
they will continue doing an amazing job over the next release as well.

For the Pike release cycle, I think we need to focus more on backing up OpenStack resources and adding more
backup engines to give more variety to OpenStack users, also we should continue working on
the core freezer features to provide stabilization.

In this cycle we will give also more attention to freezer-dr, the disaster recovery
part of freezer. It provides cloud administrators the capability to evacuate
VMs from failed compute nodes, we aim to take it to more than that and support more severe disaster.


In order to achieve that, I think we should focus on:

* Enhancing core freezer-agent features and continue refactoring the missing parts
  to allow pluggable architecture to support more engines and applications in freezer.

* Move from Elasticsearch to Oslo.db

* Fully implement Oslo.policy

* Implement version 2 of freezer-api

* Integration tests. We need to increase the work done on testing. This will
  help to stabilize Freezer.

* Documentation. We should target for a split, refactoring and global
  improvement of our docs, which is a required step to increase the size of our
  community.

* Focus on implementing OpenStack engine(s) to backup OpenStack resources.


I would be honoured to have your support.

Thanks,
Saad Zaher (szaher)
