Hi,

I would like to announce my candidacy for PTL of Horizon for Train release.
I served this role during the last two releases and I still feel strong enough
to do this role during the next six months.

We did a good job as a team during the Stein release cycle: enabled
integration tests both for Horizon and several plugins, created a good list of
priorities and TODOs to fix our huge feature gaps between UI and command-line
clients and started work on them, so you can find few more useful features in
our release notes.

During the Train cycle, I’m going to continue these efforts:

* Add integration tests for all maintained plugins so we can be sure that
  we’ve got verified list of working Horizon plugins.
* Involve project teams in Horizon: even such contributions like feature
  requests are extremely important to understand what should we do to make
  cloud users and operators happier
* We missed few community goals in the past and I’ll do my best to fix it in
  Train release.
* Last, but not least, I’ll be happy to help new contributors to be a part of
  Horizon team.

I hope you’ll give me a chance to wear a PTL hat for Train and help me with
all these efforts.

Thank you,
Ivan Kolodyazhny (e0ne)
