Iâ€™d like to thank everyone for being a tremendous support and a pleasure
to work with in the previous cycles.

In the Stein cycle, we made great progress in supporting new use cases
through expanded features and cross-project integrations.

For the Train cycle, I hope to continue serving as a facilitator to help
all the contributors drive the project forward.

Thank you all once again!
