Hello Again Infrastructure Electorate,

I am nominating myself for a fourth round of Infrastructure PTL duties.
Once again I feel that I've got some unfinished business as PTL guiding
our efforts through to completion. That said, we have made incredible
progress on our goals over the Stein cycle:

  * We are in the middle of upgrading all of our Puppetry to Puppet v4.
  * We now have the ability to deploy systems without any Puppet. We
    even have a system for deploying container images.
  * We are almost off of our old Trusty servers and on to either Xenial
    or Bionic based systems. Thank you for all the help with this, and I
    hope to see you during our final push.
  * Winterscale has a name now: OpenDev. With a name we have been able
    to deploy services like DNS and Gitea and Zuul for OpenDev.

As I have said before, I cannot take credit for all this awesome work.
Instead, as PTL, I have tried to facilitate the work of others while
helping where I can. Thank you for making all of this effort possible.

Looking ahead, we have a great foundation on which to build out OpenDev
while leaving behind legacy systems like Trusty and Puppet 3. For the
Train cycle I expect we'll push hard to "OpenDevify" our existing
services. There is great work already on the Git hosting side of things,
but as soon as that is done I would like to see us branching out and
converting more services.

It will be a fun adventure to bring our tools and services to a broader
audience. I am happy to continue guiding the team through these changes
as PTL if you will have me.

Thank you,
Clark
