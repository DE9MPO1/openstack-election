Hi,

I'd like to nominate myself to continue to serve as Solum PTL
through the Train cycle.

My goals for the Train cycle in the following areas:

 * Collaborate with other OpenStack projects with joint blueprints.
 * Acknowledgment of OpenStack-wide Goals.
 * Integration of Solum with Zun.
 * Make solum can be support oslo.privsep.

I'm happy to welcome new contributors to the project.

Thanks for taking the time to read through this roadmap and to consider my
candidacy.

Regards,

Rong Zhu
