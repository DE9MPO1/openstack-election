Hi all,

I would like to announce my candidacy to continue as Vitrage PTL for the Train
release.

Iâ€™ve been the PTL of Vitrage since the day it started and I'll be happy to
continue leading it in the next six months.

I think we've had a very successful Stein cycle. Our main features include:

* New and simplified template language
* Improved resource query APIs
* New service list API
* Integrations with more openstack components (Trove, Zaqar, Monasca)
* More flexible configuration for the Prometheus datasource

Moving forward, these are the areas that I believe we should focus on:

* Continue the cross-project work that we started in Stein. Some of our plans
  relate to the self-healing SIG effort: finish the integration with Monasca,
  allow configuring Vitrage via Heat templates for auto-healing scenarios, and
  in general integrate with more datasources - both OpenStack and external.

* Extend the Vitrage support for Kubernetes. In addition to performing root
  cause analysis over Kubernetes nodes, we would like to consider also Helm
  charts, Kubernetes deployments, and optionally pods.

* Improve the Vitrage UI, hopefully using a new React-based plugin.

* Extend the Vitrage community. I'll be happy to see more contributors joining
  our effort.

I look forward to working with you all in the coming cycle.

Thanks,
Ifat.
