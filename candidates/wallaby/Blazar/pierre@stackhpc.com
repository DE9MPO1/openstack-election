Hi,

I would like to self-nominate for the role of PTL of Blazar for the Wallaby
release cycle. I have been PTL since the Stein cycle and I am willing to
continue.

Unfortunately, Blazar has been suffering from low participation in the project.
I will keep engaging with current users and potential new ones, in order to get
more contributors involved in the project.

Thank you for your support,
Pierre Riteau (priteau)
