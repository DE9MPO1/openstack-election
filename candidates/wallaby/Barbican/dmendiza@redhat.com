Hello OpenStack,

I would like to nominate myself for Barbican PTL.

My focus for the new cycle will be to continue the maintenance and development
of the project.  We will continue to improve usability as well as continue
to enable cross-project encryption features.

We hope to deliver our first microversion revision early in the Wallaby cycle,
so tha we can finally release the Secret Consumers feature.

Thanks,
Douglas Mendiz√°bal
