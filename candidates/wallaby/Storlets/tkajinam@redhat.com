Hi All,


I'd like to announce my candidacy to run PTL role for Storlets project in the
next Wallaby cycles, to continue PTL role from the previous Victoria cycle.

In this cycle, I'll focus on the existing proposals to improve stability
and operability of Storlets. Since we have discussion slots in coming PTG,
I'll moderate the discussion there and will try to make these proposals
land during this cycle.

Thank you for your consideration !

Thank you,
Takashi Kajinami
