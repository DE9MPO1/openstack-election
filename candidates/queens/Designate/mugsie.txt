Hi All,

I would like to nominate myself as PTL for the Designate project for the 
Queens Cycle.

I have been a developer on the project since Grizzly and served as PTL for the 
Mitaka, Newton and Ocata cycles.

My main aim will be to build up contributors to the project, 
while keeping the project stable.

We missed the WSGI App goal, and barely got the python 3.5 goal complete, so 
as we already have all our tempest code in an external repo, I intend to add 
that as a priority.

With the advent of Zuul v3, we have an opportunity to expand our testing, and
as part of that, we should aim to add more complex scenarios to our testing
like:

1. Mixed Driver environments (one pool using powerDNS, one using Bind)
2. Multi DNS Server environments
3. Upgrade testing

We also need to expand the number of tested drivers, and ensure non free drivers
have a clear owner, and are tested. We also need to add clear install / 
configuration documentation per driver.

Finally, I want to ensure that the optional OpenStack DNS InterOp program is 
implemented, and complete for the next InterOp version.

Thank you for taking the time to read this, and your interest in the project.
