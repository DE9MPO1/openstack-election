Hi,

I would like to submit my candidacy for Solum PTL for the Queens cycle.

I began to contribute to Solum project since 2016.05 and joined the team as
a core reviewer in Ocata cycle. And now, I think I can take over the
responsibilities of Solum PTL.

The main goals Iâ€™d like to focus on for Solum during Queens are:
- Acknowledgment of OpenStack-wide Goals.
- Continued integration of Solum with Zun.
- Improvement of Solum's installation documentation.
- Testing improvements.

Thanks for taking the time to read through this roadmap and to consider my
candidacy.

Regards,

Rong Zhu
