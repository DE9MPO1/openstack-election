Hi all,

I've had the pleasure of serving the Zaqar community as PTL for several
cycles, and I'd like to continue for Queens cycle, if you'll have me.

We did a great job in Pike. The dead letter queue feature is landed and the
notification retry policy feature is almost there. For Queens release, things
I'd like to do which we haven't completed in Pike are:

1. Scalability
   In Zaqar, we would like to see no obvious degradation of latency or
availability when load increasing. Here "load" can refer to various dimensions
of usage:
   1) number of publishers
   2) number of subscribers
   3) rate of messages published or consumed
   4) number of messages
   5) number of queues
   6) size of messages
Above are the "load" we care about in order from my view. We got some
interesting data with OSProfiler and improved/fixed some issues in Pike. But
still need to continue this work to get better performance.

2. Availability
   Zaqar has a simple architecture which makes keeping its availability
relatively easy, for the service level. But we do still need more consideration
for the storage backend layer.

3. Latency
   Latency is a typical, important time-based measure for a messaging service.
Obvious, Zaqar would like to minimize latency wherever possible. There are three
most important latency metrics I would like to improve are:
   1) The amount of time to deliver message from producer zaqar server
   2) The amount of time to deliver message from zaqar to consumer(poll or push)
   3) The amount of time to claim a message

It's a fantastic experience working with this amazing team and I would be
pleased to serve as PTL for another cycle and I'd appreciate your vote.

Thanks for your consideration!
