Hello everyone,

I'm asking for the opportunity to continue to serve as the PTL of Glance
into the Queens cycle.

Things looked good for Glance at the start of Pike.  We had a strong set
of active cores, and discussed plans at the PTG for recruiting more
developers to the team through holding bugsmash events and developing a
more organized approach to triaging bugs to a point where they could be
worked on by developers not yet experienced in working with Glance.  We
were interested in attracting new talent because we had recently lost
our team:diverse-affiliation tag [0] which was a warning that Glance had
become too reliant on two companies.  And in fact when those companies
decided to change direction early in the cycle, the impact on Glance was
devastating.  However, due to the hard work of those who remained and
developers from the wider community who pitched in [1], we were able to
complete a revised list of priorities for Pike and did not require any
kind of drastic intervention (such as going into maintenance mode, which
looked like a real possibility in April).  And, on the plus side, we'll
definitely be receiving the team:diverse-affiliation tag the next time
it's assessed.

The point of mentioning the above history is that I'd like to continue
the reorganization and recruitment work we'd discussed at the beginning
of Pike, which should improve the project's health for the Rocky PTL,
who will most likely not be me.  Or at least there's no reason why it
should be me, as some of my goals for Queens are to help grow the Glance
community and help any Glancer who's interested (hopefully, more than
one) get themselves into a position to become an effective PTL.

So that's the general nature of what I think we should focus on in
Queens.  There are a few specifics that I should probably mention:

* Image import continued -- thanks to Erno's hard work, a minimal viable
  product of image import has landed in Pike.  There are a few obvious
  Glance-side improvements we can make, but at Pike RC-1 time, I plan to
  notify operators that the MVP of image import is available, they
  should look it over, and give us feedback on what enhancements are
  necessary, and think about how they can direct development resources
  to Glance to make those changes happen.

* Rolling upgrades -- we released zero-downtime upgrades as an
  experimental feature in Ocata, but further work planned for Pike
  (primarily, in-gate testing of upgrades) did not happen.  It's
  important to get this completed in Queens.

* Operator communication -- the popular operator surveys that we were
  using to gather usage information about Glance were another casuality
  of the personnel situation in Pike; I'd like to get those going again.

Additionally, there are some small worthwhile features among the
untargeted approved specs that would be nice to land, and new specs are
already showing up in the Queens directory.  And of course Glance will
participate in the Queens community goals.  We'll sort out the
priorities at the PTG [2].

Finally, there's been some discussion on the ML about whether Glance has
outlived its usefulness and should be replaced [3,4].  I'm willing to
discuss that at the PTG, but as you can tell from the fact that I listed
it last, I think there's still a role for Glance in the Queens cycle.

Thanks for reading, and thanks for your consideration,
brian
