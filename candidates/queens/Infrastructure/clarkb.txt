As another development cycle quickly approaches I would like to be
considered for the role of Infrastructure PTL. I have been working on
the OpenStack Infrastructure as a core reviewer and root user for about
five years now. During this time I have done just about everything an
Infrastructure team member can do except for take on PTL duties. I
would like to give that role a shot now.

The Infrastructure team has accomplished amazing things to scale both
up and out. We run a large set of services that can handle thousands of
test jobs per hour merging hundreds of commits per day. I am proud to
have been a part of the work to make this possible; however, looking
forward I think we face a new set of challenges.

In particular I see a need for making our Infrastructure more sustainable
so that it can weather the changing priorities of our community.
I think we can do that by focusing on these three items:

  * Continue to automate all the things
  * Simplify the process of consuming Infrastructure resources
  * Run more of the Infrastructure in multiple clouds

Deploying Zuul v3 in order to make continuous integration configuration
properly self service will go a long way to making this a reality.
I would also like to see the team take lessons learned from Nodepool and
Zuul's use of distributed state management to properly distribute other
services so that they can be run in multiple cloud regions or even
across multiple clouds.

I can not do these things alone; it will require a team effort. If you'd
like to see the Infrastructure team work towards these goals I will do
my best as PTL to ensure we work as a team to accomplish these goals.

Thank you for your consideration,
Clark
