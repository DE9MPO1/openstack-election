Hi fellow kuryrs!

I present my PTL candidacy for the Queens Cycle.

We've done well in this past cycle getting close to our first release
adding things like:
- Kubernetes service support,
- Token authentication support,
- A lot of devstack improvements like multinode
- pod-in-VM neutron trunk and macvlan support
- Resource pooling
- Octavia support

Also some things that are in-flight and that may still make it in this
cycle or early next:
- CNI split
- Containerized deployment with daemonsets
- SR-IOV support

In this new upcoming cycle I would like to bring the following things:
- Full multi-network support consistent with upstream design
- High Availability (active - active) controllers
- Controller Health and Readiness checks
- SR-IOV support
- Network Policy
- Ingress controllers

I am very thankful for all the people and organizations that have
contributed not only in code, but also in reviews, documentation,
blueprints, bugs and discussion. Serving as PTL this last cycle has
been a great pleasure and I would love to serve again.

Regards,

Toni
