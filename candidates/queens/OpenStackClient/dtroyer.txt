I am running for re-election as the OpenStackClient PTL.

The comming releases of OpenStackClient will be important as they
are likely to be the base we will live with for some time.  A number
of fundamental changes need to be made to OSC to properly support
things like fully utilizing os-client-config and its clouds.yaml
configurations and properly supporting microversions.  These changes
will have subtle impacts to backward-compatibility that force a
major version update.

This all comes at a time when many smaller projects are seeing a
dropoff in contributions.  For OSC this can be partially attributed
to the well-known business decisions of some of our member companies,
but it is also an indication that the core of OSC is nearing completion.
There will always be upstream changes that need to be chased but
thanks to the work of a number of contributors the backlog of missing
commands/features is as small as it has ever been.

Most of all, I want to see us continue our mission of providing a
(wait for it...) consistent interface to OpenStack via the CLI.
Sometimes this means changing how we think about certain operations
in individual projects, sometimes it means providing direction for new
operations, and mostly it means finding the common ground that makes
our users lives simpler.

I thank you and am honored by your support.
