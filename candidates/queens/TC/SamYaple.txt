This announces my candidacy for a spot on the OpenStack Technical Committee.

While I have normally been content to have other people make decisions, I also
want OpenStack to succeed. I have spent too many years on OpenStack to have it
fail. I think a good place for me to contribute to the dream of keeping
OpenStack going strong is the TC.

I started as an OpenStack Operator in the Essex era. The largest issue I had at
the time was deployment. I have spent a considerable amount of my time in
OpenStack working on deployment tools. Some publicly available, some not. All
of this time has kept me very close to all of the OpenStack projects. I have
to know them to deploy them. This closeness has also let me see problems arise
in and between the projects. I would like to help address those problems for
all of OpenStack.

I have no agenda. I have no long standing company affiliations. OpenStack is
something I am passionate about. I do it in my free time. I run it at my house.
I just enjoy working with it and want to see it be as easy to use as possible.
With that I know OpenStack will continue to be successful.
