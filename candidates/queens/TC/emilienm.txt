This is my candidacy for second round of a position on the OpenStack Technical
Committee.

During the last twelve months, I've contributed to Governance reviews and used my vote
by thinking outside of the box. Indeed, my experience on working with
installers is pretty unique at the TC and I find it important to represent this
world.
I've also participated in the Visioning exercise in Boston, and I believe it
helped a lot in our community. I hope we can keep iterating on this work during
the next months.
On a personal note, I really enjoyed working with the community and I believe
we keep making progress over the years.

And last but not least, I've been PTL on two different projects during
five cycles. My focus has always been to find solutions for:

- Bringing more trust in our community, and always assuming good faith by default.
  I think we have still some work to do on that area but I believe we'll
  continue to make good progress.

- Making our operators happy. Working on installers is not the same game as working
  on devstack, you have to deal with customers and people from a different
  world. I like to think we're making good progress in how do we test OpenStack.

- Scaling-up our community, by voting for governance changes but also at how we
  operate together on IRC, by e-mail or in person during events. Be more
  inclusive and help people to grow. We should kill "clubs" and unwelcoming
  places, and continue to make OpenStack the best Open-Source project to contribute
  to.

Of course you don't need to be TC member to contribute on these topics; though
changes made in Governance are voted by TC members; so I would like to be
candidate one more time.

Thank you for your consideration,
