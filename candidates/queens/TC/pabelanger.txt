Today I step outside my comfort zone and submit my name into the Technical
Committee's election.

I'm a Red Hat employee who contributes full time to the OpenStack Project
Infrastructure team and have been contributing since Folsom release (22 Sept
2012).

I submit my ballot today, not because I seek to be in the lime light but to help
fill the void of the awesome contributors before me. Like any project, I think
it is healthy to rotate new people and new ideas into a project.  It is a great
way for people to learn new leadership skills but also a way for a project to
gain new energy and share different points of views.

For my knowledge, I hope to bring an point of view from operations. While I
have contributed to OpenStack projects, my primary passion is helping provide
the OpenStack resources to contributors to make OpenStack awesome. In doing so,
working on the Infrastructure project allows for the ability to see what is
great about OpenStack and what could use improvements.

I believe you get out of something what you put into it, so here I am adding my
name of the list.

Good luck to all,
Paul Belanger
