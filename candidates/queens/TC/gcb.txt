I'm announcing my candidacy for a position on the OpenStack Technical
Committee.

I'm ChangBo Guo(AKA gcb)[1], currently working for EasyStack, leading
developers' upstream contribution on OpenStack in the company. I have been
working on the OpenStack since 2012, firstly focused on Nova and then focus
on Oslo, also contributed to several other projects[2]. I've been serving
as the PTL of Oslo (OpenStack Common libraries) for Pike and Queens.

During the last 5 years, as a developer I have the chance to talk with
users/operators, meeting users/operators' requirements and making
OpenStack more useful are important, that's the key factor to make OpenStack
successful. OpenStack has huge potential customers though some companies
adjust their investment on OpenStack. We have some progress on shortening
the feedback loop like building SIG(Special Interest Group) to involve more
users. Not all the users can raise their requirements easily due to the
barrier like language. TC may need work with UC to find more ways to collect
users/operators' requirements like we have 'Top 5 help wanted list' in
development cycle.

OpenStack is the first open source project I contributed, I've learned a lot
from community leaders in the past 5 years and guided some new contributors
how to work with other world wide contributors. It's not a easy to be
productive for a new contributor especially for whom without open source
experience. In last several cycles some key contributors changed their work,
not focus on OpenStack, in the other side, some new contributors couldn't find
'the right way' to contribute, posting trivial repeated patches, we're facing
the challenge! Though we have program 'OpenStack Upstream Institute' to training
new contributors, that's not enough for new contributor, because not all new
contributors can attend the the OpenStack Summit. TC may host more online events
to invite community leaders to communicate with new contributors, and help new
contributors to contribute in 'the right way'.

As a TC member I want to focus on shortening the feedback loop and guiding new
contributors. Thank you for your consideration!
