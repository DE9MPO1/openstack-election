OpenStackers,

I am Swapnil Kulkarni(coolsvap), I have been a ATC since Icehouse and I wish
take this opportunity to throw my hat for election to the OpenStack Technical
Committee this election cycle. I started contributing to OpenStack with
introduction at a community event and since then I have always utilized every
opportunity I had to contribute to OpenStack. I am a core reviewer at kolla
and requirements groups. I have also been active in activities to improve the
overall participation in OpenStack, through meetups, mentorship, outreach to
educational institions to name a few. 

My focus of work during TC would be to make it easier for people to get
involved in, participate, and contribute to OpenStack, to build the community.
I have had a few hickups in the recent past for community engagement and
contribution activities but my current employment gives me the flexibilty
every ATC needs and I would like to take full advantage of it and increse 
the level of contribution.

Please consider this my application and thank you for your consideration.
