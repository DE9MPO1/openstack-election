Dear Stackers,

I'm Shuquan Huang(shuquan)[1]. I started my OpenStack journey since 2011. I could
still feel the radiated joy when I first launched an instance and the
deep depression when the cluster got broken. At that time, the cloud journey was
hard and steep. Nowadays, you don't need to worry about the OpenStack running
too much. We have plenty more projects to build an OpenStack cloud and it
becomes more and more mature.

However, with the explosive growth of OpenStack, it also becomes more and more
complex. Users often get lost and just don't know how to take advantage of
OpenStack. I'v been witnesses to a variety of failures when users were adopting
OpenStack without value gained. And the project was forced to shut down.

OpenStack can't succeed without bringing value to users, otherwise it's just
some fancy technology. I believe I can help to reduce the complexities
and bring the true value of OpenStack to users as a member of OpenStack
Technical Committee. Thank you for your consideration.
