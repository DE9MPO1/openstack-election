Hi, everyone!

About me
========

* ~4 years of developing various projects in OpenStack
* ~3 years of being Rally Core Developer & Reviewer
* 2 OpenStack cycles of being official Rally PTL + 1 cycle being unofficial
  PTL
* python-novaclient core maintainer

What was done during Pike cycle?!
=================================

Long time ago Rally was started by one company and the majority of core
developers were from this company. The diversity of contributors was increased
since then. The community of Rally project become wider.
The last two cycles were a real test for Rally community. As the result, for
the end of Pike cycle, the starter company doesn't have any influence at Rally
project, no inner team at all, BUT it doesn't change the number of commits and
reviews in Rally project.
We succeeded in building independent and open project!

As for the technical side of Rally project, see our release notes ;)

Tasks for the next cycle
========================

1. Make one of the greatest project more awesome. I know it is a hard task,
   but until we do not support such things like emacs did (for example
   https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CoffeeMode), we have a space for
   improvements.

2. To experiment with voice meetings. It doesn't mean that we want to or will
   abandon regular text meetings, not at all. It should be just an experiment
   for improving communication between various teams and companies.

3. More slides, presentations, mails with updates and what is going on.

4. More recording of demos

5. Support of various platforms

6. Better documentation

7. More and more
