Hi,

I would like to nominate myself to take the role of Murano PTL for Queens
release.

I’ve been working on the project for the past couple years. Working with
Murano is probably the most exciting thing I do professionally. It is my 
pleasure to work with the great team to make this project better and
better, and we will keep moving and look forward to push Murano
to the next level.

In past cycles, we have done a lot of great works. We got moving policy
into code, allow encrypting of muranopl properties, add api ref docs,
bug fixes and so on. Thanks for everyone's hard working.

I’m really excited to work with Murano further, and to grow the community
surrounding it. The more companies that contribute to Murano, the stronger the
community around it will be, capable of maintaining and enhancing Murano for
years to come.

The main goals I’d like to focus on for Murano during Queens are:
 * Acknowledgment of OpenStack-wide Goals.
 * Add Murano-dashboard sanity_check CI job.
 * Significantly improve Murano documentation.
 * Murano’s integration with GLARE.
 * Focus on addressing a number of outstanding bugs in Murano. These include
   adding SIGHUP signal support to Murano, support multiple rabbit hosts in
   RabbitMQ for Murano Agent, and addressing other UI bugs, like abandon
   environment hanging issues.
 * Increase developer contribution in Murano through my own coding efforts,
   as well as through ZTE’s resources.

Thanks for taking the time to read through this roadmap and to consider my
candidacy. Regardless of the outcome, I'm excited to continue contributing
to Murano, be it code or code reviews.

Regards,

Rong Zhu
