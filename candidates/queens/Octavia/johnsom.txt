My fellow OpenStack community,

I would like to nominate myself for Octavia PTL for Queens. I am currently
the PTL for the Pike release series and would like to continue helping our
team provide network load balancing services for OpenStack.

For those of you that do not know me, I work for Rackspace. Prior to joining
Rackspace I worked for Hewlett-Packard for fifteen years on data center
automation, distributed network systems, embedded system design, and big data.

During Pike, the Octavia team made huge progress by implementing the Octavia
v2 API, adding a new and up to date API reference, implementing a OpenStack
client plugin, new health monitoring capabilities, and many more enhancements.

As we start to plan for Queens, I expect we will have a focus on adding the
provider interface to the Octavia v2 API, flavors, Active/Active load balancer
support, and implement a new tempest plugin for Octavia.  I also want to
maintain our priority on providing onboarding support for new contributors to
get involved with Octavia.

Thank you for your support of Octavia during Pike and your consideration for
Queens,

Michael Johnson (johnsom)
