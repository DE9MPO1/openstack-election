Hi everybody!

I've been trying to justify why you should all select me as PTL for Stable
branch maintenance.  As part of that I've looked at my self-nomination
platforms for Ocata[1] and Pike[2].

 1. Work with project teams to understand how decisions taken on master will
    impact their stable branches.  Specifically projects with a driver model.
 2. Work with project teams to implement constraints support
 3. Growing the project specific, and stable-maint teams
 4. Re-establishing regular team meetings and presence in #openstack-stable
 5. Producing tooling to aid projects teams, release managers and the stable
    team to keep stable branches current and released with a regular cadence
 6. Producing tooling and procedures to help retire projects as required

Some tools are better, some process is clearer but I haven't completed any of
those items, I could make excuses based on things that have happened in the last
6 months but I feel the bottom line is  I don't know *how* to do those items.  I'm better at the technical stuff than I am at the helping people grow.

So if y'all will have me I promise to:

* Work on the items in the list above[3]
* Lean on the community and TC to help be achieve the parts I can't do on my
  own.
* Give it all I can
