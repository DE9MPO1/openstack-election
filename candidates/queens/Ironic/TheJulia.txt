Greetings carbon based lifeforms!

I am hereby announcing my candidacy and self nomination for the
queens cycle ironic PTL position. For those of you that know me,
I'm sure I've left an impression.

For those that don't know me! Hi! I'm TheJulia. *waves hello*
I've been working in the OpenStack community since the Juno cycle,
and within the ironic project since the Kilo cycle. Prior to my time
in the OpenStack community, I worked on many system large scale
infrastructure systems and have spent far too many hours in cold data
centers installing and re-configuring hardware than I would ever like
to recollect.

Perhaps that is why I feel passionate about Ironic, its community,
and users. I know what the pain of deploying baremetal is like,
and I wish to make it better. I have no specific agenda aside from
wanting to try and peel back some of the bureaucracy and process
that slows and hampers our work.

My vision, my hope, is for the ironic community to continue to grow
and to become more vibrant than ever.

This doesn't mean we don't have neat/awesome/cool things to do, but
neat technology comes secondary to community and its culture.

Thanks!

-Julia Kreger
