Hello everyone!

I would like to announce my candidacy for the Winstackers PTL election.

I have been involved in OpenStack since Havana, and even longer with Hyper-V
and Windows related technologies, and I have been the PTL of Winstackers for 4
cycles.

Feature-wise, things have become stable, meaning that there are only a few
features that we'd like to implement. The primary focus of this cycle has been
bug fixing, and feature test coverage. In this regard, we have added a new
project into the Winstackers governance: oswin-tempest-plugin [1], which will
help us make sure that previously added features and future ones work as
intended.

The Hyper-V CI has been upgraded to use Hyper-V Server 2016 nodes, which means
that it will be able to test features that are only available on Windows /
Hyper-V Server 2016 or newer (vNIC hotplugging, Linux Secure Boot).

We have added reno support in os-win and networking-hyperv, and we're planning
on using release notes when needed.

We have also added an ansible role for adding Hyper-V as compute nodes using
Kolla [2].

There are a few items which have not been completed yet, such as:

* SR-IOV support. This feature was delayed due to the lack of proper hardware
  to test it with, but at the moment, we are close to having a functioning POC.
  At the moment, the os-win patch has been sent [3], and the networking-hyperv
  and nova patches will soon follow. At the moment, the plan is to have the
  neutron-hyperv-agent act as the neutron sriov-agent equivalent on Hyper-V.
  We'll have to see how it will work with OVS and the neutron-ovs-agent.

* Windows / Hyper-V Server 2016 Network Controller support. At the moment, the
  Network Controller python client is implemented [4], the agent side of the
  HNV Controller is implemented, and the HNV ML2 mechanism driver is currently
  under review.


In the new cycle, I'd like us to accomplish the following goals:

* Finish the items mentioned above.

* Add more tests in oswin-tempest-plugin, get the Hyper-V CI to run over the
  project, and include the tests in the Hyper-V CI in relevant OpenStack
  projects.

* Improve documentation.


We are currently looking into different Hyper-V features, their utility, and
how they can be integrated into OpenStack, which means that the list of
objectives get longer as times passes on. New goals and suggestions are
welcome, of course.


Thank you for your consideration,

Claudiu Belu
