Hello,

I would like to announce my canadidacy for Chef OpenStack PTL for the Queens
cycle.

I have been a core member since Chef OpenStack became an official project, and
have previously served as PTL. This would be my third non-consecutive cycle as
PTL.

During my time, I have written many patches for the cookbooks to support the
OpenStack use case, at a much slower trajectory than the core projects. For the
next cycle, I will continue to be focused on developer enablement and general
throughput, with a particular focus on improving the testing capabilities.

My primary goal is to continue to get us back on track as a project, and closer
to core's release cadence by addressing stabilization and technical debt issues.

I seek to improve active participation and contribution, to keep up with the
changes not only in the rest of OpenStack, but Chef as well.

I feel these are attainable goals, even with our reduced participant size. I
intend to keep doing what I can to progress the project and legitimize the
existence. As part of the core team, I am also taking a more active role in
maintaining the public presence of Chef OpenStack, in an attempt to further
raise awareness of the project's activity and be a more active participant in
the community.

Best,

sc`
