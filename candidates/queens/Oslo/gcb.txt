Hi All,

I would like to announce my candidacy for the Oslo PTL election.

I have been involved with Oslo since the last few years, it's my honor to
work with the great Oslo team and serve as PTL in Pike cycle.

We achieved some significant milestones in the Pike cycle and we have the
fortune of having a number of experienced and previous PTLs in the team that
makes the job of a new PTL easier. In the Queens cycle, we still focus on our
project mission: "aims to produce a set of Python libraries containing
code shared by OpenStack projects. The APIs provided by these libraries should
be high quality, stable, consistent, documented and generally applicable".

I believe our focus in the Queens cycle would include:

- Attract more developers to contribute for Oslo
- work with other team closely, deliver stable common libraries
- Improve documentations to help developers use Oslo libraries smoothly.
- Collect new ideas and generate new libraries.

Thank you for your consideration
