This is my self-nomination to continue running as Tacker PTL for the
Queens cycle.

In Pike cycle, tacker team is focusing on stablebility and scaling. We have
introtroduced Barbican to keep VIM credentials and Mistral to do VIM
monitoring and policies. These are great steps to let Tacker to be stable
and scalable. In addition, the team has been active in promoting tacker.
We have joined OPNFV meeting, OpenStack days China and OpenStack
design summit in Boston.  There are some topic sessions which are
proposed to Syndey Summit by team.

In Queens cycle, I plan to

- Continue to stablize tacker and make it of production quality.
- Complete tacker document.
- Provide kolla way to install tacker. I think tacker will be installed in kolla which put
  tacker in containers. The container way will make tacker easier to use,
  help many guys to use tacker in short way, compared to devstack installation.
- introduce more kinds of VIMs
- Promote tacker into other communities.

Lets make tacker roll together.

Thanks for your consideration.
