Fellow Barbicaneers,

I'd like to nominate myself to continue to serve as Barbican PTL
through the Queens cycle.

First and foremost, I want to maintain our team's culture.

My goals for the Queens cycle are to continue the progress made during
the Pike cycle in the following areas:

1) Grow the Barbican team of contributors and core reviewers.
2) Collaborate with other OpenStack projects with joint blueprints.
3) Maintain our high standards for code reviews and unit and functional tests.
4) Be diligent with backporting bug fixes to stable releases.
5) Shrink our backlog of open bugs and patches.
6) Enable new adoption through improved documentation.
7) Develop new secret store plugins, or key store alternatives, that are
both secure and easy to use.  Vault interoperability looks like a good
area for new development in this regard.

Thank you in advance for this opportunity to serve.
