I'm announcing my candidacy to continue as the PTL for Searchlight
for the Queens cycle. I've been a core contributor since the project
began and PTL since the start of the Ocata cycle.

My goals for Queens are mainly to try to increase community
involvement and usage. We have some interesting ideas in the works
for integrating with Zaqar and Horizon, and I also want to continue
to improve the way we ingest data.

I look forward to hopefully continuing as PTL for Queens!
