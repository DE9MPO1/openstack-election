Hi all,

I'd like to announce my candidacy for the PTL role of Senlin Project for
Queens cycle.

I began to contribute to Senlin project since 2016.05 and joined the team as
a core reviewer in Ocata cycle. It is my pleasure to work with the great team
to make this project better and better, and we will keep moving and look
forward to push Senlin to the next level.

In past cycles, we have done a lot of great works. As a clustering service,
we already can handle some resource types like nova server, heat stack .etc.
What's more, we already have some small steps for supporting NFV & k8s use
cases.

As a PTL, I'd like to focus on the tasks as follows:

- Improve runtime data processing inside Senlin server
- Improved AZ & Region placement policy
- Improved health policy to provide HA support
- A better support to NFV use cases
- Add support to k8s use cases
- A stronger team to push Senlin to next level

Again, it is my pleasure to work with such a great team.

Thanks

Ruijie Yuan
