Hi,

I'm Renat Akhmerov. Mistral and things around it are still my main focus.
So I'm running for PTL of Mistral in Queens.
Mistral is a workflow service developed within the OpenStack community from
the ground up.

In Pike we finally finished the main part of Custom Actions API work: made
first releases of mistra-lib that contains needed classes for developing
custom actions, adjusted all the code to use mistral-lib and fixed all the
needed dependencies. Other achievements are: significantly improved docs,
implemented advanced publishing mechanism that allows publish workflow
variables more flexibly and into different scopes (branch local and global),
actions can now run right in the engine (no need in external executors)
which is beneficial in a number of cases, OpenStack actions now can run
in different regions, a number of memory leaks eliminated and huge number
of other bugfixes and improvements in both server and client sides. Also,
we prepared a detailed spec on what needs to be done for HA and started
working on it.

For the next cycle I'd like to propose the following roadmap:

* Improve performance
  * Less overhead per task
  * Big workflow graphs
  * Optimize ‘join’ tasks
* Improve multi-node mode and HA
* Close all the gaps in the documentation and restructure it so it is more
  convenient to read and navigate
* Usability
  * New CLI/API (more consistent and human friendly interface)
  * Debugging workflows
  * Workflow failure analysis (error messages, navigate through nested
    workflows etc.)
* Refactor Actions subsystem
  * Actions testability
  * Move OpenStack actions into mistral-extra and with better test coverage
    and usability
  * Actions versioning (i.e. actions working with different versions of
    OpenStack services)

Should you have any ideas on these points we're always happy to discuss and
correct our plans.

We're always happy to get new contributors on the project and always ready
to help people interested in Mistral development get up to speed. The best
way to get in touch with us is IRC channel #openstack-mistral.
