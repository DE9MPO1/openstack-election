Hi All,

I would like to nominate myself to take the role of Heat PTL for Queens
release.

I'd been involved with the project around two years. And it's my privilege to
work and learn within this great team and have the honor to serve as Pike PTL.
No doubt, heat already become the engine for other OpenStack services who try
to deploy and manage a scale services or applications. With some excellent jobs
from the team, we got great improvements on resources, py35, WSGI, bug fixes,
infrastructure, agents, and templates which I don't think we can do it without
anyone in the team. And as what we always open for more ideas to join, it's
essential to embrace following jobs:

- Cross projects integration and improvement
- Welcome any developers/ops/users who work on heat in any format
- Make project goals. Also following community goals and project goals to make
  sure it will complete.
- Provide as many resources and guidelines for members as possible when they
  need it. To make it more efficient when working on Heat.
- Ensuring that CI jobs are healthy (and we don't break other projects)
- On time releases with effective coordination and collaboration

So these are targets that I think we can work on. We will open to any idea,
and give it full discussion and help.

In past cycle, I do get a lot of help from other experienced members, which
allows me to learn and grow. And I tend to keep learning and growing from any
opinions and experiences good or bad.
As usual, my goal is to reach all above targets and make sure this team will
be able to keep running well, keep integration to new things, and always open
to ideas. This means we will keep trying and making mistake on the way, but
the result must be worth.

Hope you will consider me for Queens PTL.

Thank you!
Rico
