Hi everyone,

I would like to announce my candidacy for PTL of Horizon for Queens; Rob Cresswell
will be supporting me as co-PTL.

I have been actively contributing to Horizon for over two years and became a
core developer during the Pike cycle, as well as maintaining downstream customizations
for Horizon. This gives me a good understanding of both upstream and downstream concerns.

As PTL of Horizon, I would like to drive Horizon’s development in the following areas:

- Complete work on the Angular overview and instances panel that has been started,
  as these currently suffer from poor performance

- Ensure Horizon continues to be a robust and highly customizable dashboard

- Keep up with the updates in other OpenStack projects; during Pike, we began work on
adding support for Neutron QoS and Trunk ports, which we should complete early in
the Queens cycle.

- Maintain an accurate blueprint list and invest more time in bug triage

I am grateful for Rob’s help in taking on this responsibility and I look forward to
working with you all to make Horizon a better OpenStack dashboard in the Queens release.


Regards,
Ying
