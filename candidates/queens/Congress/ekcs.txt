First, Iâ€™d like to thank everyone for being a tremendous support
and a pleasure to work with in the previous cycles.

In the Pike cycle, we made great strides in usability and ease-of-adoption.

For the Queens cycle, I hope to continue serving as a facilitator to help
all the contributors drive the project forward.

Thank you all once again!
