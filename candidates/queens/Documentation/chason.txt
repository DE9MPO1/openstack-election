Hello everyone,

I would like to announce my candidacy for Documentation PTL (Queens).

First of all, I wish to introduce myself briefly. I have been working on the bugs
of openstack-manuals project since the Liberty release. And the most I fixed is
the bugs of the Install Guide. In my opinion, Openstack is not very friendly with
new hand. If they install their first openstack environment according to our Install
Guide which may not be very accurate, she or he would be in a mess. I will continue
to focus on document bugs whether as a reviewer or PTL.

In this cycle, Alex( asettle) has coordinated the doc migration work [1]. I wish to
take this opportunity to thank all members of the OpenStack community who partcipated
in this work. We cannot achieve such seriously bug stuff without your cooperation. :) 

As you can see, we removed several guides from openstack-manuals project. There are
still many things [2] we have not yet to accomplished after the doc migration.
Some of these problems we already have solutions. But the others need to be discussed.
We are welcome everyone to join in our discussion[3]. It would be wonderful if you can
give us some ideas!

If I am elected PTL of the Documentation project, my focuses for the coming release
are to grow the Documentation team, keep the accuracy of documents, and work closely
with other projects to help them imporve documents.

Thanks for your consideration, and I am looking forward to work together with all of
you on getting the OpenStack documents to the next stage.

Cheers,

Chason
