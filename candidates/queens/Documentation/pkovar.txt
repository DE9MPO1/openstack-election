Hi all,

I'd like to announce my candidacy for PTL of the docs project for Queens.

I've been active in various open source documentation and
translation projects since 2007 and started contributing to OpenStack
docs during the Mitaka cycle, both upstream and in the RDO Project.

The docs project has recently seen a significant decrease in both the
number of submitted updates and contributors, but thanks to a group of
dedicated people in the community, we've managed to come up with a clear
plan to migrate docs over to individual projects, restructure them and
reduce the scope to keep them maintainable. This is now well underway and
I'd like to help the team and the community drive and continue with this
work.

In docs, we generally like to keep it rather short and simple, so let me
summarize the main three points as follows:

Support and help drive the remaining tasks in restructuring and/or moving
content from the core docs suite.

Help establish the docs team as content editors for individual project docs
when needed or requested.

Stay open and friendly to new contributors, no matter if they are
prospective core members or drive-by docs contributors, with the
understanding that docs are a great way to get involved in the project for
both the non- and developers.

Thank you!
