I would like to announce my self nomination for the PTL candidacy in Tricircle
Queens cycle. My name is Zhiyuan Cai, and my IRC handle is zhiyuan. As a core
reviewer of Tricircle project, I have been actively participating in the
development of this project since Mitaka cycle.

During the Pike cycle, many fancy features are brought to Tricircle, like VxLAN
support for cross Neutron L2/L3 networking, VLAN aware VMs, service function
chaining; reliability and performance are improved for the asynchronous job
running daemon; multi-region gate job is set up to test Tricircle in a real
running OpenStack environment, a YAML based task schema is introduced to help
developers to define the test scenario more easily.

For the coming Queens cycle, here are some works we can focus on:

* Continue the development of advanced networking features, like QoS and LBaaS.
* Improve the test scenario coverage of multi-region gate job.
* Examine the integration with Nova cell V2.

Hope everyone will enjoy running and developing Tricircle.

Thank you for your kind consideration of my candidacy.
