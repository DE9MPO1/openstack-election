Hi All

I would like to announce my candidacy for PTL of the OpenStack Charms project
for the Queens development cycle.

We've made some good progress during the Pike cycle in terms of improving
documentation, with a new deployment guide in the works which should make things
much easier for new users of the OpenStack Charms going forwards; There is still
work todo here and that's something I want to make sure we focus on during the
next development cycle.

We also have a number of cleanups that need to be completed; ZeroMQ and PostgreSQL
support in the charms are obsolete and not covered by any testing so should be
dropped during Queens.  We also need to make the jump to Python 3 by default
across all charms.

I look forward to steering the helm for another cycle!

Cheers

James
