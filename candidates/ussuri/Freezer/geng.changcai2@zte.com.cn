Hi!
I'd like to announce my candidacy for PTL role of Freezer for the U cycle.

At the end of the Rocky cycle, the TC intended to remove Freezer from the
Governance(OpenStack official projects). The reasons for that are because
Freezer has missed several milestones, etc. With the efforts of former PTL
and other contributors, freezer already has a lot of functions of backup
software, and can be basically used, although there are some problems.
I think it would be a pity if it was removed. In order not to waste previous
efforts, I temporarily served as freezer's PTL. We improved the related
problems and put it into practice as our backup system products,
With many cores' and my efforts, we have done a lot of jobs in the Stein
version. In Stein, our main work:

In the Train version, the project is not too active for various reasons,
and some of the targets in the Train version are not completed,
but the version is basically maintained. I hope that in the U version
I will try to invest more time in Freezer.

Here is what we'll aim to accomplish in the U cycle:

* Docs improvements
* Unit Test Improvement: Our goal is to make it reach 60%.
* Reporting error logs: When the jobs are executed, if there are errors,
  the serious errors should be reported to freezer-api.
* Monitor the schedule agent is on-line or not: Provide an API interface
  to query whether the schedule agent is online, so that the application
  can quickly learn the status of the agent.
* Remote backups: Remote backup is an important function in backup service.
  After supporting remote backup, we can do disaster recovery for important backup data,
  or copy data from one backup system to another backup system, etc.

Best Regards,
