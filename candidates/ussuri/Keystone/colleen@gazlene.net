I'd like to submit my candidacy to remain serving as keystone PTL for the next
cycle.

It has been my privilege to serve as PTL for this past cycle, during which we
made progress on several major issues, especially on transitioning our RBAC
model to steer away from the admin-ness problem and to understand read-only
roles, as well as enhancing application credentials with fine-grained access
control and support for federated users.

In the upcoming cycle, policy and RBAC continue to be a top priority. As we
near the completion of migrating keystone's own policies to understand system
scope and default roles, we need to look forward to driving these changes
across the rest of OpenStack while ensuring as smooth a transition as possible
for operators and end users. Beyond that, my top focus will be on incrementally
improving the quality of keystone as a product, starting with enhancing our
testing to ensure it is more stable and reliable and encompasses all the
scenarios that are important to us, from rolling upgrades to federation to
performance testing. As more and more we face a simple lack of people-hours
within the team to drive massive features, my strategy will be to remove
roadblocks like CI issues and technical debt in order to empower new and
existing contributors to drive the features they want to see in keystone,
whether that is quota limits, federation enhancements, better support for Edge
use cases, or whatever other life-improving ideas come up.

Thank you for your consideration,

Colleen (cmurphy)
