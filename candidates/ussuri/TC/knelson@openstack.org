Hello Everyone :)

I am declaring my candidacy for the TC election.

Roles like PTL and TC member are incredibly important when it comes to enabling
others’ success and removing roadblocks that stand between contributors (new or
established) and the work they want to do. Much of the work I have done over the
years has had this focus, and as an elected member of the TC I think I could have
an even larger impact.

A little background on me: I have been working on OpenStack since 2015 (Liberty
release). I started with getting involved organizing and mentoring in the Women of
OpenStack’s mentoring programs and developing Cinder before branching out to
 os-brick and on to other roles. Since then, I have been involved in many different
projects and efforts focused on supporting the larger community.

Highlights:

- Onboarded over 300 global contributors as instructor at OpenStack Upstream
   Institute (OUI) building our contributor community in places like Brazil, Korea,
   and Vietnam[1]
- Developed the curriculum of OUI, including the Contributor Guide[2].
- Evolved OpenStack’s various mentoring programs[3] and actively participated in
  them, including our community’s involvement in the Outreachy Program[4].
- Established the First Contact SIG[5].
- Coordinated the community’s ongoing migration to StoryBoard from Launchpad
- Presided over 5 releases of (Pike-Train) technical elections (both PTL and TC) as
  an election official
- Served on the Release Management, Cinder, & Infrastructure (StoryBoard) teams
- Helped organize Forums, PTGs, and other in-person gatherings
- Collaborated with the k8s community to improve both our community’s various
  onboarding programs

My experience teaching Upstream Institute and running the First Contact SIG has
helped me build skills that will be beneficial as a TC member, such as making
connections between new contributors and existing projects or efforts. This ability
to make connections and start conversations will support our community’s cross
project efforts as they continue to be a challenge that I will help the TC overcome.

My previous work has afforded me the opportunity to interact with almost every
OpenStack project and understand how they operate differently from one another.
Each project has its own culture; understanding that and how to engage with each
of them is incredibly important for the Technical Committee to achieve selected
community goals and other cross project efforts.


As a member of the TC, I will seek to lower the barrier to entry to roles like contributor
or even PTL. There is a lot of duplicate and stale information for setting up the accounts
and tools needed to get started which should be cleaned up. Individual project
contributor documentation[6][7] doesn’t exist for all the projects currently and would be
valuable. Individual project PTL guides (similar to the Release Management process
doc[8]) would also benefit our community as it would smooth the transition from one
PTL to another and minimize the loss of tribal knowledge, especially when these
transitions happen in the middle of a cycle. I’ve proposed this contributor
documentation focus as a community goal for the U release[9].  Anything we can
do to make a cohesive path for new community members to work their way to roles
like PTL will ensure the health and success of our future.

I love this community and all the awesome people in it, serving on the TC would be a
great experience and an honor.

Thank you,
Kendall (diablo_rojo)
