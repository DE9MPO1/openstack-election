Hi, everyone!

I do not want to write a lot of redundant words and promises, so here is a
brief summary:

* I served as Rally PTL for 3 OpenStack cycles (plus 1 unofficial cycle)
* We succeeded in finishing several big refactoring changes which blocked us
  for years
* There are a lot of things to be done, no time to stop and relax
* I'm happy to announce my candidacy for the next OpenStack cycle
