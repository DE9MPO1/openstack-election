Hi All,

I am nominating myself for the PTL of Designate for the Rocky cycle.

Designate has had a "rocky" road of recent (see what I did there?) but we are 
now through to the other side. We have regular contributors, and are rebuilding
the core team from them. 

Previous cycles have been used to make sure we did not break the gate, and
were still working well with other projects. Now we have the opportunity to 
start adding new features, and highlighting to deployers and end users why
they should use Designate as part of the cloud.

I see some easy wins for us, that would make DNS admins lives better - simple
things like letting a user set the serial number of a DNS Zone, or share access
to a Zone (I have been converted on the last point).

I also think that we have scope for one major feature, and I think we can 
deliver a basic implementation of DNSSEC in this cycle, which would allow us
to iterate on, and add more advanced behaviors later.

Our Docs have improved dramatically over the last 18 months, but I think we 
still have some way to go to make them really useful for end users, and
as part of that I think we need to drive an engagement with our users and
most importantly our deployers. This is a longer term goal for us, but I think
the Rocky cycle is the time to start.

Thanks for taking the time to read this,

 - Graham Hayes
