Hey everyone,
  
I would like to nominate myself for the PTL role for the Puppet OpenStack team
for the Rocky release cycle.  

During my time over the past period, we continued to maintain the stability of
the modules, helped keep the gate moving and helped in migrating all projects
to Zuul V3.

I hope to continue to serve as the PTL for the upcoming cycle to keep reviewing
contributions and "keeping the ship sailing" with the wonderful Puppet OpenStack
team.

I'm always available on IRC and I look forward to working with all of you for
the upcoming cycle.  I'm also always open to suggestions or recommendation on
how we can do things better, as this is for the benefit of all of us.

Sincerely,
Mohammed Naser (mnaser)
