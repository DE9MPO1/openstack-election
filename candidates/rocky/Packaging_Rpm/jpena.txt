Hello fellow packagers!

I would like to announce my candidacy to be the PTL for the Packaging Rpm
project during the Rocky development cycle.

During the last cycles, the project has become a great collaboration space for
people working on RPM packages for OpenStack products. We have a number of
great tools that help us in different areas, even beyond the boundaries of
RPM-based distributions [1], and a wide, up-to-date package set.

For the Rocky cycle, my focus would be on:

* Fixing 3rd party CI annoyances: we are often getting hit by known issues in
  the 3rd party CI systems. Let's try to work on those known issues and reduce
  their occurrence to a minimum, so we can spend more time on reviews and less
  time troubleshooting our CI.

* Work on getting the packages created by the project tested by some installer
  project. This would greatly help us in improving quality on those small
  details that only get caught during real life tests.

* Expanding OpenStack distribution usage of the artifacts generated by the
  Packaging Rpm project.

That, of course, would be in addition to our common goals: expanding our
contributor base, improving collaboration between RPM distributions, and
keeping a high quality set of packages.

Thanks for reading,
Javier
