Hello,

I am announcing my candidacy to continue as Chef OpenStack PTL for the Rocky cycle.

Chef OpenStack, or openstack-chef, as we also call it, automates OpenStack
deployments using Chef (https://www.chef.io). The cookbooks have been around
since the Grizzly cycle, joining as an OpenStack Big Tent project in Liberty.

I have worked with OpenStack since Grizzly, first as a deployer/operator. My
journey with open source dates back to the late 90s. I began contributing to
OpenStack in Kilo, and joined openstack-chef as a core reviewer, where I have
worked on the cookbooks to make them delightful, or, at least, less painful to
work with. I have been involved in many features and assisted numerous
contributors with landing changes to the project since then[0][1].  I previously
served as PTL for the Newton, Ocata and Queens cycles.

For the Rocky cycle, I would like to focus on the following:

* Eliminating the gap between local testing and CI by extending the work done
  for Pike.
* Further leveraging the Chef ecosystem to expand the visibility of the
  cookbooks. For example, delivering cookbook updates to the Chef Supermarket.
* Enabling scenario-based testing within CI.
* Fostering more external contributions and mentor contributors.
* Priming the cookbooks for Chef 14 and beyond.

The cookbooks will continue to be supported in the capacity they have been, with
time permitting. The intent of accomplishing the above is to lower the barrier
to entry, to encourage future maintainership from the community. This is an
iterative process, so any suggestions or new additions are definitely welcome.

Thank you.

Samuel Cassiba (sc`)
