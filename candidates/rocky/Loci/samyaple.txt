Hi everyone,

I'd like to announce my candidacy to continue as the LOCI PTL for the Rocky
cycle.

As most of us know, LOCI is simple enough to mostly run itself, but we do still
need someone to blame when things break. I purpose me for the task.

The goals in Rocky i would like to see followed are short and sweet:
 * Cross-gatting with Kolla-Ansible and OpenStack-Helm
 * Build support for all the official OpenStack projects
 * Automated build support for all official OpenStack projects like we currently have for Keystone

To put those goals another way... better gates. Improvement there will go a long way.

Thank you!
SamYaple
