I'd be honored to continue to serve as your PTL for OpenStack Swift.

My general philosophy of being a PTL is to report externally what the
community is working on, put the right people in contact with each
other when something needs doing, and understanding what's going on in
the broader storage ecosystem in order to provide some direction to
the community on what's important.

I've been privileged to have been PTL for Swift for quite some time,
and I'm proud of all that we've been able to accomplish together as a
community. As Swift PTL for the Rocky cycle, I will continue to do my
best to make Swift used everywhere, every day, by everyone.
