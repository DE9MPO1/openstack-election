Hi All,

This time, I'd like to keep my position on the Storlet PTL as I've been
taking the role from eranrom on the Queen cycle.

I know, the Storlets project is a small team yet but still my company (NTT)
is working on several use cases and I'd love to keep the door open from the
great OpenStack community.

In the Queen cycle, the Storlets team has been focusing on the stability and
manage the stable testing environment, including zuul v3 migration and 1.0.0
release will be at the final Queen release. In the future Rocky cycle,
I'd like to progress the project more. In my idea, I'd like to focus on
mainly, A) Reach out to more users and hence to developers, B) Capability on
better flexible resource control for HPC/AI use cases, C) Continuous work on
the maturity.

I believe that I can take the responsibility on the project management on the
Storlets project and hope I can enjoy with more newer contributors in the
OpenStack developers community.

Best regards,
Kota
