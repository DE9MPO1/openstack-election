I would like to propose my candidacy for Dragonflow PTL position.

I have been working on Dragonflow for over two years, including related
projects such as Neutron, Openstack-Ansible, and ovsdbapp.

My goal for Dragonflow is to make it a reference architecture to implement
networking and distributed networking services in an easy and simple
manner while supporting production grade and large scale requirements.

I think that Dragonflow's pluggable architecture is proving to be a
strong choice, and is even being considered at other OpenStack networking
projects. In the previsous cycle we worked to improve this. Now it is
even easier and simpler to extend Dragonflow, and allow external vendors
to write their own drivers and applications.

I also believe that our simplicity can be very appealing to users that
want a simple network virtualisation solution part of OpenStack.

It is my hope that the distributed architecture we have insisted on will
pay off when moving onwards to new challenges.

For the next cycle, I would like to see Dragonflow become a viable choice
for cloud deployments, SD-WAN, and massively distributed deployments. This
means a heavy stress on stabilisation, deployment, and performance.

I would also like to see new features make it into the release, such as
LBaaS. I would also like to see the completion of the Kuryr
integration, and have Dragonflow as a reference network implementation
for Kubernetes.

Thank you,
Omer Anson (oanson).
