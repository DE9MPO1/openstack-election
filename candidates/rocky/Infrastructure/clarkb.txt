Queens was my first cycle as Infra PTL, and I would like to make Rocky
my second.

We did some great things last cycle from onboarding new cores and roots,
deploying Zuul v3, starting large scale operating system upgrades, to
updating our hosting services to handle non OpenStack top level project
hosting. As amazing as this work has been much of it is unfinished and
I would like to help carry this work through to completion as PTL.

As PTL I would push us to continue and complete the work listed above.
Specifically I think we should:

  * Release Zuul v3 this cycle and continue to improve it for both
    OpenStack and others.
  * Continue to pay down existing tech debt by upgrading operating
    systems and services like Gerrit.
  * Welcome new projects like Kata and do our best to accommodate
    them while continuing to provide service to OpenStack.
  * Improve the onboarding process for new Infra contributors and
    grow the Infra team. This will involve more explicit tracking
    of work items and educating new groups of people on how the
    Infra team and its tools function.

If this sounds like a good plan for the next six months I would
appreciate your vote.

Thank you for your consideration,
Clark
