I would like to nominate myself for the TripleO PTL role for the Rocky cycle.

As PTL of TripleO for the Queens cycle, the focus was on improving containerized
services, improving the deployment process and CI, and improving
visibility of the status of the project. I personally believe over the last
cycle we've made great strides on all these fronts.  For Rocky, I would like
to continue to focus on:

* Reducing duplication and tech debt
  When we switched over to containerization, we've had to implement some items
  in multiple places to support backwards compatibility. I believe it's time
  to spend some efforts to reduce duplication of code and processes and focus
  on simplifying actions for the end user.  An example of this will be efforts
  to align the undercloud and overcloud deployment processes.

* Simplifying the deployment process
  Additionally with the containerization switch, we've added new requirements
  for actions that must be performed by the end user to deploy OpenStack.
  I believe we should spend time looking at what actions we can remove or reduce
  by automating them as part of the deployment process.  An example of this
  will be efforts to enable autodiscovery for the nodes on the undercloud
  as well as switching to the config-download by default.

* Continued efforts around CI
  We've made great strides in stablizing the CI as well as implementing zuul v3.
  We need to continue to move our CI into fully native zuul v3 actions and
  focus on developers ability to reproduce CI outside of the upstream.

Thanks,
Alex Schultz
