Hi Team,

I'd like to announce my candidacy to continue as the OpenStack-Helm PTL
for the Rocky cycle.

I have been working in the OpenStack community for about a year and a half,
helping lead upstream development efforts for my employer.  In this capacity
I worked to bring new OpenStack contributors up to speed, help them understand
and keep them aligned to community goals, and to be the voice of community and
upstream-first development within my workplace.  More recently I have had the
privilege of taking a more hands-on role with OpenStack-Helm, and have served
as PTL as it transitioned to become an Official OpenStack project.

OpenStack-Helm is a technically impressive project, and has the potential to
not only redefine how OpenStack clouds are deployed and operated, but also to
help redefine what it means to be an OpenStack cloud, by allowing simple
stitching together of OpenStack and third-party components into custom
solutions.  However, the reason OpenStack-Helm is successful is because of a
passionate team of talented engineers who work tirelessly to push the boundary
of what's possible with containerized technology.  I'm humbled daily by
this team, and a key goal of mine in the Rocky cycle is to enable you, help
you succeed, and grow your ranks.  I see PTL as a servant leader role.

In the Rocky release I would like to accomplish the following:
* Cut our 1.0 OpenStack-Helm release
* Build the skills and experience of the existing OpenStack-Helm team members
* Create mentoring/onboarding opportunities to onboard new team members quickly
* Build gates for Ocata and begin to ensure compatibility with Pike and Queens
* Develop and formalize our plans for OpenStack-Helm releases
* Groom a more diverse core reviewer team
* Harden OpenStack-Helm resiliency, scalability, and day 2 ops
* Create ops-oriented documentation for OpenStack-Helm
* Achieve OpenStack-Helm cross-gating with other projects
* Collaborate with other project teams on their charts' development

Thank you for your consideration!
Matt McEuen
