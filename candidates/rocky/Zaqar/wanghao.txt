Hi all,

It's very pleasure for me that being a Zaqar developer from 2016, and also
being a core for several cycles. Today, I'd like to serve Zaqar better as a
PTL, if you let me.

We did a great job in Queens. Support the new relationship between pool and
flavor to make removing useless pool group available. We also introduce some
awesome new features like support redis as management storage backed to
improve performance and ease of deployment and delay queue.
For Rocky release, I want to finish the list of job below.

1. Refactoring
   We want to remove useless pool group totally in Rock and make the model of
   pool and flavor more clear.

2. Scalability
   We will continue our work to improve Zaqar's performance under the different
   cases of load increasing:
   1) number of publishers
   2) number of subscribers
   3) rate of messages published or consumed
   4) number of messages
   5) number of queues
   6) size of messages

3. Usability
   Now Zaqar still don't support the filter query of queues. Considering the
   amount of queues in cloud environmentï¼Œwe want to support the filter query
   to improve the usability and efficiency of querying API.

3. Security
   In Rocky, we also want to introduce some features that could make the
   message more safe and queue more reliable.

It's a fantastic experience working with this amazing team and I would be
pleased to serve as PTL for next cycle and I'd appreciate your vote.

Thanks for your consideration!
