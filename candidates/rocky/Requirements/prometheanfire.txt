I would like to announce my candidacy for PTL of the Requirements project for
the Rocky cycle.

The following will be my goals for the cycle, in order of importance:

1. The primary goal is to keep a tight rein on global-requirements and
upper-constraints updates.

2. Speaking of global-requirements updates, the primary goal this cycle will
continue to work on project specific requirements.  All projects would continue
to use upper-constraints.txt to ensure co-installability, but would be able to
manage their requirements.txt file, largely on their own.

https://bugs.launchpad.net/openstack-requirements/+bug/1719009 is the bug
tracking per-project requirements.

3. Un-cap requirements where possible (stuff like eventlet).

4. Publish constraints and requirements to streamline the freeze process.

https://bugs.launchpad.net/openstack-requirements/+bug/1719006 is the bug
tracking the publish job.

5. Audit global-requirements and upper-constraints for redundancies.  One of
the rules we have for new entrants to global-requirements and/or
upper-constraints is that they be non-redundant.  Keeping that rule in mind,
audit the list of requirements for possible redundancies and if possible,
reduce the number of requirements we manage.

6.  Audit global-requirements minimums.  While technically not supported from a
co-installability or stability standpoint (as it's not tested), we should
endeavor to have the global-requirements minimums work in Openstack.  Ensuring
any bugs, features or changes that have happened since the global-requirements
minimum was released til the upper-constraints was defined are not NEEDED by
Openstack.  This will rely on the cross gating work tonyb did.

I look forward to continue working with you in this cycle, as your PTL or not.

Thanks for your time,
Matthew Thode
