I am submitting my self nomination to serve as the RefStack PTL for
the Rocky development cycle. For the Rocky cycle, I will continue
to focus efforts on moving the RefStack Server and Client into
maintenance mode. Outstanding tasks include:

	* Adding funtionality to upload subunit data for test results.
  * Adding Tempest autoconfiguration to the client.
  * Updating library dependencies.
  * Providing consistent API documentation.

In the previous cycle, the Tempest Autoconfig project was added to
RefStack governance. Another goal of the Rocky cycle is to transition
project leadership to the Tempest Autoconfig team, as this project is
where the majority of future work is going to happen.

Thank you,

Chris Hoge
