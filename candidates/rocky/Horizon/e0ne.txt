Hello Team,

I would like to announce my candidacy for PTL of Horizon for Rocky release.


I use Horizon since I begin to work with OpenStack in Diablo timeframe. I
wasn't active contributor before Pike release, nevertheless, I can see how
both Horizon project and community changed over the times. I became Core
Reviewer in Queens and worked mostly on bug-fixing and other improvements.


Being a PTL is a challenging task especially for such project as Horizon. We
should be close both to the other OpenStack components and provide a great user
experience for cloud users and operators.


As a PTL I will focus on the following areas:

* Continue to work on Horizon stabilization and improvements to bring great UX
  for large-scale deployments.

* Finish work on mox to mock migrations in unit tests.

* Improve our integrational tests.

* Help everybody to contribute to Horizon via reviews, features implementations
  and bugfixes.


I know, that being a PTL is a hard job, but we've got a good team and we'll do
our best to make Horizon a bit better during the next cycle.


Thank you,
Ivan Kolodyazhny (e0ne)
