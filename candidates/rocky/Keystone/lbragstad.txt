Hey folks,

I'm writing to express my interest in continuing to serve as keystone's
PTL for the Rocky release.

Even though we're a few weeks away from an official Queens release, I
felt we had an extremely productive cycle. The outcome of the Queens PTG
in Denver was nothing short of ambitious. We finished up things that
missed the boat for Pike, while shouldering some hefty new initiatives.
To summarize:

* We helped projects move their default policies into code and document them,
  which makes maintenance for operators and deployers much more manageable
* We implemented full support for tagging project resources, which has been a
  long-time ask from operators
* We landed an implementation for application credentials, making it easier to
  run apps that integrate with OpenStack - especially for deployments backing to
  LDAP
* We implemented an experimental API for unified limits, which opens the doors
  for us to start integrating consistent quota enforcement across services
* We introduced a new assignment target and token scope to help set
  administrative APIs apart from end user APIs
* Lastly, our team did a good job stepping up to mentor new contributors

The following are a few of my top priorities for Rocky:

* Help projects leverage system scope to improve the usability and security of
  their APIs
* Build on the in-code policy work to provide discoverable capability APIs
* Put together a plan to make unified limits a stable API and help incorporate
  its usage into other projects
* Continue fostering an environment where newcomers feel welcome and can make
  meaningful contributions

In my nomination for the Pike cycle, I mentioned that I wanted to do
what I could to solve the hard problems our community is faced with.
It's extremely encouraging to see the needle move on several
long-standing issues, especially with a systematic, team-oriented
approach. It's been great to be a part of those efforts.

Thanks for taking the time to read this and I hope to see you in Dublin,

Lance
