Hi everybody!

Just like with my queens platform[1] I've spent a lot of time asking myself
*if* I should run for the PTL position. Given I'm writing this it's pretty
obvious that I chose to ;P  From there the next question is why should the
community elect me?  As many others have pointed out serving as PTL is an
honour and my impact in the community has been reducing for the last 12 months
:(

For me the key is that the Stable Branch Maintenance "project" is in a major
state of change with the very fuzzy Longer life stable branches[2] and the
potential for altering the development cycle length[3] each of which has the
potential to drastically alter how the stable branches operate, let alone
combined.  Also since the Boston summit there has been a move to pull Operators
and Developers together ins SIG[4] and I'm wondering if that makes sense for
the stable branch maintainers.

Like most teams we need more contributors, the stable branch gate while it
enjoys a lot of stability for the last 2 cycles has begun to decline.  A
disturbing trend we need to not just halt but reverse.

So my objectives for the next cycle are:

 1. Work with the TC, UC, Operators and Developers to remove some of the fuzz
    from the longer life stable branch discussion[5].
 2. Work with the TC to ensure that stable branch maintenance is considered
    when we look at altering the development cycle
 3. Reduce the number of periodic gate failures back to Ocata levels.
 4. Give it all I can

Thank you for reading.
Tony.

[2] For better ot worse LTS is so tied to the Ubuntu implementation that I avoid that acronym in this context
