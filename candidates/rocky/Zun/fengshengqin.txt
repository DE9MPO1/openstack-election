Hi all,

I'd like to nominated myself to be a candidate of Zun PTL through
the Rocky cycle. 

Over the past year the Zun project has achieved a lot of the important
features includes:
* Cinder/Glance/Neutron integration.
* NFV: Containerized NFV workload is emerging and we wants to adapt this trend.
* Alternative container runtime: Introduce a second container runtime as a
  Docker alternative.
* Capsule API: Pack multiple containers into a managed unit.

My goals for the Rocky cycle are to continue the progress made during
the Queens cycle in the following areas:
* Diskspace Management: Docker images and containers use the same space,
  it's better to choose a compute node to load images by DiskFilter
  and limit the diskspace of a container.
* Zun-monitor: Monitor the status of containers, the zun-compute services, 
  the memory/cpu/diskspace of the zun-compute, then report the
  error/warning/notice to end-users.
* Zun-alarm: Define the zun alarm and report them.
* Heal and evacuate: A periodic task monitors the status of container. 
  If a error happends, the container should be healed or evacuated.
* Placement API: Nova team is working to split its scheduler out and Zun would
  like to leverage this new service if appropriate.
* Containers-on-VMs: Provide an option to auto-provision VMs for containers.
  This is for use cases that containers need to be strongly isolated by VMs.
* Kubernetes: Kubernetes is probably the most popluar containers orchestration
  tool, but there are still some gaps that prevent Kubernetes to work well with
  OpenStack. I think Zun might be able to help to reduce the gaps. We could
  explore integration options for Kubernetes to make OpenStack more appealing
  for cloud-native users.

Thank you for taking the time to consider me for Rocky PTL.

Best regards,
Shengqin Feng
