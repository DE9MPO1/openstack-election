I am running for re-election as the OpenStackClient PTL.

OpenStackClient development has slowed considerably in the last cycle
or two, in large part because the majority of the commands for the APIs
included in the OSC repo are implemented and only require maintnance
to keep track with the API changes.

OSC will have a major release coming soon that will have some minor
backward-incompatibilities in global option handling.  It will include
increased use of the merged Shade+OpenStack SDK once a 1.0 release of
that project has been cut.

I thank you and am honored by your continued support.
