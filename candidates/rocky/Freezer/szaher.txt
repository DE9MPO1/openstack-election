Hi All,

I'm happy to announce my candidacy to be the Freezer PTL for the Rocky release
cycle.

In the past cycles we were working on stabilizing the core freezer engine to
handle the backup and working on good schema to store freezer backups.

We haven't seen much work in Queens as lots of team members are doing something
different at the moment so it was mainly fixing bugs and maintaining freezer repos.
The main thing we had in Queens was publishing freezer documentation to help
users install freezer as well as understand how it works, hoping to get more
contributors on board during up coming cycles.

I think my main focus during Rocky will be to get freezer community going and
get more members to join our freezer team.


In the Rocky cycle, I think we are going to focus on the following items:


* Working hard on the community part to keep it going and get more people on
  boarded to freezer will be my top priority. I believe this is the most
  important task for freezer PTL for the time being.

* Maintain freezer core and fixing bugs

* We have been facing some issues to on the move to oslo.db like do we keep
 support for elasticsearch or not, also smooth updates between release if we
 keep elasticsearch, so I think in Rocky this needs to be resolved by implementing
 a driver for oslo.db as well as keep the elasticsearch support and working on upgrade methodology

* Decouple backups from users (tightly coupled) and make it more related to
  tenants


I would be honoured to have your support.

Thanks,
Saad Zaher (szaher)
