All,

This note is to declare my candidacy for the Cinder, Rocky PTL position.

I can't believe that Queens is already drawing to a close and that I have been
PTL for a whole release already.  I have enjoyed this new challenge and learned
so much more about OpenStack as a result of being able to serve as a PTL.
It has grown not only my understanding of Cinder but of OpenStack and what it has
to offer our end users.

I feel that the Queens release has gone smoothly and as I have been looking at
the notes from the Queens PTG I think we have been successful at addressing many
of the goals that the team set back in Denver.  We have been successful in getting
the development team to take ownership of our documentation.  We have focused on
fixing bugs in Cinder and improving our existing functions as I had hoped we would
be able to do.  We have even seen some return to growth in the development team.
All momentum that I would like to see us maintain.

So, I hope that you all will give me a chance to apply what I have learned during
the last 6 months by supporting me in another term as Cinder's PTL.

Sincerely,

Jay Bryant (jungleboyj)
