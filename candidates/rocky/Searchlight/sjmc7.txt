This is to announce my candicacy to continue as the PTL for Searchlight
for Rocky. I've been PTL since the Ocata cycle.

Searchlight is in maintenance mode but still receives active bug fixes. The project
has suffered from a drop off in contributors over the last cycle but is still in
use. My goal for Rocky is to keep things ticking over until such time as things
pick back up again.
