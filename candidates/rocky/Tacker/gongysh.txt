This is my self-nomination to continue running as Tacker PTL for the
Rocky cycle.

Lots happened in Takcer Queens cycle. More documents, More features are coming
in. VNFFG is enhanced, Kubernetes vim and container VNF are introduced.
Private Zabbix based application monitoring is done too. Openstack client Tacker
commands are also being developed.


In Rocky cycle, I plan to

- Continue to stablize tacker and make it of production quality.
- Go on with tacker document.
- Enhance container based VNF
- Make a way to connect VM based VNF and container Based VNF
- Introduce more types of VIM, such as public vim, SDN controller vim


Thanks for your consideration.
