Hi Everybody!

I am hereby announcing my candidacy and self nomination for the
Rocky cycle ironic PTL position.

I'm fairly certian most of you know me by this point and know how
much I care about the community as well as our efforts to automate
the deployment and configuration of baremetal infrastructure.

For those of you who do not yet know me, I've been involved in
OpenStack since the beginning of the Juno cycle, and have been working
with the ironic community since the beginning of the Kilo cycle.

I am very passionate about ironic, but I recognize that there is more
work to be done, new directions to head in, and challenges to conquer.

My vision is for ironic to be utilized in more use cases outside of
what we have typically seen as our primary user. It is necessary to
expand on existing relationships and to build new relationships going
forward. 

My hope is for us to continue to grow as a community. While we have
had set backs like all projects, we still have massive potential.

Thank you for your consideration.

Julia Kreger (TheJulia)
