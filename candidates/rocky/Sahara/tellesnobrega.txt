Hi Saharans, I would like to nominate myself to act as PTL for Sahara during
the Rocky cycle.

I've been acting as PTL for the last two cycles (Pike and Queens) and I believe
that even though we lost a lot of resources we were able to improve Sahara
considerably in the last year. 

Moving forward I aim to continue working on the direction of making Sahara more
user oriented.

* Bug triaging:

We need to start testing and cleaning the bug list and sadly this queue did not
decrease significantly and we need to keep working on it.

* Documentation:

We already had improvements this lasy cycle but we need to keep going and for
that we are already planning a documentation day pre-PTG and during PTG.

* Final APIv2 work

We need to finally release APIv2 in Rocky. We released APIv2 as experimental in
Queens and will work to have it as main API in Rocky.

In the overall picture we need to continue improving user experience and asking
what is necessary to make Sahara more usable so we can have Sahara in more and
more OpenStack deployments.
