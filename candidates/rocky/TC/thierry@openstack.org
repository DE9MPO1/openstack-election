Hi everyone,

Growing new leaders has been a focus of the Technical Committee over the
last year: first discussed at the leadership workshop with Board members
in March 2017, then included in the TC "vision for 2019"[1] adopted in June.

As part of this objective, we actively looked for new stewards in our
community, provided opportunities to step up, and rotated key roles to
develop a deeper bench of ready leaders. But we never applied those ideas
for the TC chair position itself: I have been the only candidate and holding
that position since the creation of that governance body in 2012. The main
reason for it is that tracking everything that's happening is a significant
commitment, and the Foundation is happy with me investing that time in. That
said, it's not ideal to have a role that only one person can fill, so it's
time for a change.

I am announcing my candidacy for a position on the OpenStack Technical
Committee in the upcoming election. However, if I'm elected I won't be a
candidate to the chair position for the upcoming TC session. To ensure a
seamless transition I will actively support the person who will be chosen
by the TC members. In all cases I'll be as involved with the TC activities
as I've always been.

In my opinion our vision for 2019[1] is still current. We have a lot of
work ahead of us to fully implement it, especially around the concept of
"Constellations" (representation of groups of OpenStack components that
answer a specific use case). Beyond that, our main challenge is to continue
to adapt OpenStack governance to the evolving needs of the project. Most of
our processes and structures come from back when we doubled activity every
year, when our main focus was to survive that meteoritic growth. With
OpenStack getting more mature and having more adoption, we need to rethink
those processes and structures with long-term sustainability in mind.
Finally, we need to navigate a transition where everything produced by
our community will no longer necessarily be called "OpenStack", starting
with Zuul being given its own separate branding.

If you're passionate about open source project governance and interested
in tackling those challenges, please consider running for the Technical
Committee ! Several of the current members won't be running for re-election,
so seats are up for grabs.  We track current proposed changes on a Tracker[2],
track work items on StoryBoard[3], and usually meet in person at Summits and
PTGs. You can read past weekly "TC status update" emails to get a better
idea of the type of things we cover. I would say the time commitment is
between 2 and 6 hours a week. Join us !
