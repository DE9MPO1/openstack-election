Hi all,

I would like to nominate myself to be the Karbor PTL for the Rocky cycle.

I began to contribute to Karbor project since 2016.01, as a core reviewer
from Newton cycle, and as Karbor PTL for the Queens cycle. It is my pleasure
to work with the great team to make this project better and better.

In Queens we have done a lot of great works about OpenStack resources protection
in karbor: API support the checkpoint verification. Support quotas. Support
checkpoint cross AZ copy API. Cross-site backup and restore. Support freezer
protection plugin. Support K8S pods protection integration. Implement policies
in code.
Other achievements are: Support operation log api. Support API json schema
validation. Support service management API and so on.

For the next cycle I'd like to focus on the tasks as follows:

- Grow the Karbor team of contributors
- Cross projects integration and improvement
- Make project goals. Also following community goals and project goals to make
  sure it will complete.
- Usability: documentation, karbor client and Karbor Horizon. Ensure Karbor
  Horizon and client continue to be a robust and easy-to-use tool for Karbor.

If you have any ideas on these points we're always happy to discuss and
correct our plans.

We're always happy to get new contributors on the project and always ready
to help people interested in Karbor development get up to speed. I'm excited
to continue contributing to Karbor.

Best Regards,
Chen Ying
