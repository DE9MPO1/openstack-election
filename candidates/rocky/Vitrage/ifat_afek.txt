Hi all,

I would like to announce my candidacy to continue as Vitrage PTL for the Rocky
release.

Iâ€™ve been the PTL of Vitrage since the day it started, in the Mitaka release.
I think we have made an amazing journey, and we now have a mature, stable and
well known project. During the Queens cycle our community has grown, and we
managed to complete many important tasks, like:

* API for template add and template delete
* Enhancements in the templates language
* API for registering web hooks on Vitrage alarms
* Performance enhancements, mostly around parallel evaluation of the templates

I believe that these new features will greatly improve the usability of
Vitrage.

As for the Rocky cycle, I think we have many challenging tasks in our road map.
We have a great team which combines very experienced contributors and
enthusiastic newcomers, and we are always happy to welcome new contributors.

The issues that I think we should focus on are:

* Alarm and resource aggregation
* Proactive RCA (Root Cause Analysis)
* RCA history
* Kubernetes Support
* API enhancements, mostly around the topology queries

I look forward to working with you all in the coming cycle.

Thanks,
Ifat.
