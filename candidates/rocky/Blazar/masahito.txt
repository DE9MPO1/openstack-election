Dear everyone,

I'd like to announce my candidacy as the PTL for the OpenStack Blazar
team in the Rocky cycle.

I served as the Blazar PTL during the Queens release. And I'd like to
keep the position in the next cycle.

During Queens cycle, the Blazar team became an OpenStack official project.
This was one of achievements by the great activities of the Blazar team
revived from the Ocata cycle. Of course, the Blazar team will do a first
official release in part of OpenStack Queens release.

In the Queens release, we improved resiliency and user experience.
The state-machine feature enables end users to understand status of leases
and reservations, the Host Panel support in horizon plugin allows operators
to handle all Blazar API by GUI and etc.

In the Rocky cycle, I'd like to focus on the following things:

- Cross project: integrating Blazar with other projects

The Blazar has some possibilities of cross project integration. The
"integration" is not only supporting additional reservation type but using
Blazar as internal function of other projects.

The Blazar is used in some areas, Sicentific area as well as NFV area.
This background brings requests of integrating Blazar with other projects,
Heat, Tacker, Ironic, PlacementAPI team and etc.

- Community: Encouraging the team and project well-known

The Blazar is not a well known project in OpenStack community in spite
of the fact that there're lots of requests for Reservation as a Service.
To make the situation better, I try to encourage the project more known.
It could also help the team to be more diverse and eventually improve
the Blazar project itself.

best regards,
Masahito
