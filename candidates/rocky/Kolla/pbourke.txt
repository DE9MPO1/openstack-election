Hello all,

I've been involved with Kolla since it's early stages around Liberty, where we
saw it evolve through multiple iterations of image formats, orchestration
methods and patterns into the project we know and love.

From my perspective the community is one of the best things about Kolla. You
are the ones that keep config files up to date as OpenStack evolves, continue
to implement new roles and images, keep the gates up and running, the list goes
on. With this mind, I won't list a bunch of features that I'd like to
accomplish for Rocky. Rather, I would like to spend time listening to what you
as users would like to see in the project, and doing whatever I possibly can to
help you achieve that. This does not mean I don't have a vision for Kolla - no
project is perfect, and there are plenty of areas I think could use some
refinement. My hope is through discussion and collaboration we can continue to
iterate to ensure this project is as useful as possible to our users.

I hope you will consider me to serve you as your PTL for the coming cycle.

Thank you!

-Paul
