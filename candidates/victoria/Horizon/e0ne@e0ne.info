Hi,

I would like to announce my candidacy for PTL of Horizon for Victoria release.

I served this role since Rocky till train release so I know how it is being
a PTL.

There are no promises from me this time. A limited capacity of the whole
team affects all activities in the community, so I would like to pay attention
to the following areas:

* Help new contributors to work both on Horizon and plugins

* More cross-project communication: Horizon uses other projects so it would
  be great to have at least some regular feedback from projects teams.

* Get rid of legacy dependencies. I know, it's a big goal. I'm pretty sure
  we'll send several releases to reach it.


PTL can't do anything without a team. Let's do our best together to make
Horizon better during the next release.


Thank you,
Ivan Kolodyazhny (e0ne)
