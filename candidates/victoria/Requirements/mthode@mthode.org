I would like to announce my candidacy for PTL of the Requirements project for
the Victoria cycle.

The following will be my goals for the cycle, in order of importance:

1. The primary goal is to keep a tight rein on global-requirements and
upper-constraints updates.  (Keep things working well)

2. Un-cap requirements where possible (stuff like cmd2).

3. Clean up requirements now that python2 is dead

4. Audit global-requirements and upper-constraints for redundancies.  One of
the rules we have for new entrants to global-requirements and/or
upper-constraints is that they be non-redundant.  Keeping that rule in mind,
audit the list of requirements for possible redundancies and if possible,
reduce the number of requirements we manage.  Json libs are on the short list
this go around.

I look forward to continue working with you in this cycle, as your PTL or not.

Thanks for your time,
Matthew Thode
