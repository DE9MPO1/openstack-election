Hello,

I am hereby announcing my candidancy as OpenStack Chef PTL for the
Victoria release cycle.

Over the past year we have made a lot of progress on cleaning up and
improving OpenStack Chef both in testing and functionality.

My goals for the coming release cycle:

- Get cookbooks updated to support Train, Ussuri and Victoria releases
- Add support for CentOS 8
- Update to Chef 16 (once released)

Thanks-

Lance Albertson (ramereth)
