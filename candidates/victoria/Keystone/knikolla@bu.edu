Please consider my candidacy for the role of keystone PTL for the Victoria
cycle.

I have been involved with keystone and the OpenStack community for 4 years
now, wearing the hats of user, operator, and developer. During these years,
my focus has mostly been on identity federation and single sign-on.

Iâ€™m deeply grateful to all the people that have mentored me and helped me
throughout the years, and I promise that if I am elected PTL I will strive
to provide a welcoming environment for all, especially new contributors.

My focus will primarily be that of a maintainer and enabler. Ensuring that
there are no roadblocks to contributions by making sure the CI is well oiled,
our documentation is up to date, that reviews get the attention they need,
that releases get done, and that lists end with an oxford comma.

The introduction of weekly bug duty during the Ussuri cycle was successful
in ensuring new bug reports get triaged and fixed in a timely manned.
I will continue that process and fill in the gaps in the weeks that no one
else can take that duty.

A lot of the work done in the last few cycles was cross-project work such
as system scope, more granular default roles, and unified limits. I will
continue to monitor the progress of their implementation and consumption
in other projects.

Disclaimer: I will not be able to devote 100% of my time to working on
keystone, however I will have the flexibility to devote the necessary time
when something requests it.

Thank you,
Kristi Nikolla
