Hi,

I would like to self-nominate to serve as PTL of Blazar for the Victoria
release cycle. I have been PTL since the Stein cycle and I am willing to
continue in this role.

As with many other projects, we are struggling with a lack of contributions. My
focus will be to keep our small community active, help new contributors to be
more involved in the project, and deliver functionality that will encourage
further adoption.

Thank you for your support,
Pierre Riteau (priteau)
